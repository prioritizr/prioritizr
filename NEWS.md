# prioritizr 8.0.6

## Notice

- CRAN release.

## New features

- New `add_min_penalties_objective()` function to generate solutions that
  focus on minimizing the penalties -- as much as possible -- whilst ensuring
  that (i) the cost of the solution does not exceed a budget and (ii) all
  feature representation targets are met. This function is designed to aid with
  hierarchical multi-objective optimization. It can be now used instead of
  specifying a minimum set objective with zero costs and
  a linear constraint to specify the budget.
- New `add_rank_importance()` function to evaluate the relative importance of
  planning units selected in a solution (#337). Briefly, this approach involves
  generating incremental prioritizations with increasing budgets, wherein
  planning units selected in a previous increment are locked in to the
  following solution. Additionally, locked out constraints are used to ensure
  that only planning units selected in the original solution are available for
  selection. The advantages of this approach are that it can (i) be computed
  relatively quickly for relatively large problems, (ii) account for the cost
  of different planning units, (iii) account for multiple management zones, and
  (iv) apply to solutions generated using any objective function.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Update `adjacency_matrix()`, `intersecting_units()`, `rij_matrix()`,
  `eval_target_coverage_summary()`, and `problem()` to improve processing speed.
- Update `intersecting_units()` to accommodate very large `sf::st_sf()` objects.
- Update `rij_matrix()` so that it has an optional `idx` parameter which
  can be used to specify planning unit indices if they have been pre-computed.
  This new parameter can be used to help speed up calculations.
- Update `add_locked_in_constraints()` and `add_locked_out_constraints()` to
  throw error messages with standardized grammar.
- Update internal functions for processing `sf::st_sf()` objects to improve
  processing speed.
- Update `add_cplex_solver()` error message for failing to initialize CPLEX.
- Update error message for internal matrix conversion function.
- Fix typo in error for importance and evaluation functions that
  is thrown when attempting to use a `solution` that is a different
  class than the planning units in `x`.
- Fix bug with warnings displaying the name of internal functions instead
  of user facing functions.
- Fix typo in citation information.

## Documentation updates

- Update Package overview and Calibrating trade-offs vignettes with information
  on the `add_min_penalties_objective()` function.
- Update `add_max_utility_objective()` documentation to make it clear that
  the function is simply maximizing a weighted sum of the features.
- Update publication record.
- Update Calibrating trade-offs vignette to improve internal logic for
  determining the best guess penalty value for preliminary prioritizations.
- Small documentation improvements. Thanks to Sandra Neubert (\@sandra-neubert).

# prioritizr 8.0.5

## Notice

- Abandoned candidate for CRAN release. Although this version was originally
  a candidate for CRAN release, we decided to add more functionality.

# prioritizr 8.0.4.5

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Update `rij_matrix()` to improve memory efficiency when processing
  large-scale vector (e.g., `sf::st_sf()`) planning unit data. Thanks to
  Sahebeh Karimi for bug report.
- Update `rij_matrix()` so that the `memory = TRUE` parameter can be used to
  reduce memory requirements by processing each feature layer separately. This
  parameter can now be used when processing both vector or raster planning
  unit data (previously it could only be used with raster planning unit data).

## Documentation updates

- Fix DOI for citation.
- Fix citations in package overview vignette and package manual entry to
  pass package checks.

# prioritizr 8.0.4.4

## Documentation updates

- Update package citation.
- Update documentation for package manual entry.
- Update `add_asym_connectivity_penalties()`, `add_connectivity_penalties()`
  `marxan_connectivity_data_to_matrix()` documentation so that examples
  are standalone and do not affect the session by loading packages.
- Update `marxan_boundary_data_to_matrix()` and
  `marxan_connectivity_data_to_matrix()` documentation so that examples
  provides more information on how the functions work.
- Fix equation rendering in online documentation (#344). Thanks to Jason
  Everett (\@jaseeverett) and Anthony Richardson (\@ric325) for bug report.

# prioritizr 8.0.4.3

## Documentation updates

- Update `marxan_boundary_data_to_matrix()` and
  `marxan_connectivity_data_to_matrix()` documentation so that examples
  are standalone and do not affect the session by loading packages.

# prioritizr 8.0.4.2

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in `add_max_utility_objective()` that caused the optimization
  process to throw an error about problem infeasibility when using
  feature data that contain negative values (#334). Thanks to \@hannahmp
  for bug report.
- Fix bug in `presolve_check()` that would cause it to erroneously suggest that
  many planning units don't have any feature data associated with them. This
  bug was caused when the feature data contained relatively large, negative values.
- Fix bug in `binary_stack()` that caused it to throw an error when working
  with raster data containing zeros (#333).
- Fix bug in `add_absolute_targets()` where it would not throw a warning to
  the user know that a problem already had targets defined, and so adding
  the new targets would override the existing targets defined for the problem.
- Fix bug in `as.ZonesRaster` that resulted in an error when trying to
  convert a `SpatRaster` zones object (i.e., a `zones` object with _terra_
  package data) into `Raster` zones object (i.e., a `zones` object with
  _raster_ package data).
- Fix bug in `write_problem()` needlessly printing messages about the
  _gurobi_ package not being installed when the function is trying to
  automatically determine which solver to use (i.e., when using
  `solver = NULL`) and the package is not is available.
- Fix bug in `branch_matrix()` where it would not automatically convert
  object to the `phylo` class in the _ape_ package.
- Update warning message for `add_asym_connectivity_penalties()` so that
  it now specifies that asymmetric connectivity values are required when
  symmetric values are incorrectly supplied (#339). Thanks to \@DanWismer for
  bug report.
- Update warning messages so that they now indicate which function threw
  the warning message (using `rlang::warn()`).
- Update `compile()` so that it throws an error when using the expanded
  version of a problem formulation with negative feature values. This
  is because the expanded version of the problem formulations are not
  compatible with negative feature values. Currently, the expanded
  version of the problem formulation is only required when using
  `add_feature_contiguity_constraints()`.
- Additional tests to improve test coverage.
- Small improvements to code style, maintainability, and logic thanks to code
  review by Sandra Neubert (\@sandra-neubert).

## Documentation updates

- Update publication record.
- Fix cross-reference linking issues to classes in other packages (#340).

# prioritizr 8.0.4.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix issue with `print()` and `summarize()` not displaying correct text for
  linear constraints (#330).

# prioritizr 8.0.4

## Notice

- CRAN release.

# prioritizr 8.0.3.7

## Notice

- New default portfolio method for `problem()` objects. This
  new default portfolio -- which can be manually specified using
  `add_default_portfolio()` -- involves simply generating a single solution.
  The reason why this new default portfolio method was chosen was because
  planning problems that contain insufficient data (e.g., feature and cost
  data) to identify meaningful priorities can sometimes result in solutions
  containing strange spatial artifacts (e.g., lines or bands of selected
  planning units, see #205 and #268). Since the presence of these spatial
  artifacts can indicate an under-specified problem and shuffling
  optimization problems can suppress them, we have
  decided to update the default portfolio so that it does not shuffle problems.
  If users wish to prevent spatial artifacts from appearing in solutions, then
  spatial penalties (e.g., `add_boundary_penalties()`), spatial constraints
  (e.g., `add_neighbor_constraints()`), or shuffle portfolios
  (e.g., `add_shuffle_portfolio(number_solutions = 1)`) can be used.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- New `add_default_portfolio()` function for specifying the default
  behavior for generating a solution (see Notice above for further details).
- Update `solve()` so that it provides information on the optimality of
  solutions (#323). For example, you might specify a 10% optimality gap
  for the optimization process (e.g., using `add_highs_solver(gap = 0.1)`), and
  this might produce a solution that is at least 7% from optimality. The
  resulting output from `solve()` will now provide this information about
  the solution (i.e., the 7% from optimality), and can be accessed
  using the `gap` attribute (e.g., `attr(x, "gap")`, where `x` is the output
  from `solve()`). Note that this information is currently only available when
  using the Gurobi or HiGHS solvers.
- Fix bug in `add_linear_constraints()` and `add_linear_penalties()` that
  resulted in an incorrect error message being shown (#324).
- Fix bug in `add_shuffle_portfolio()` that prevented solvers from using a
  pre-specified starting solution (per the `start` parameter) correctly.
  Please note that this bug did not result in incorrect solutions, it only
  meant that any pre-specified starting solutions were not used properly.
- Fix bug in `add_cplex_solver()` that caused solutions to not provide
  runtime information for the optimization process.

# prioritizr 8.0.3.6

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in `add_shuffle_portfolio()` so that optimization problems are
  randomly shuffled when a single solution is requested. This update should
  help prevent "strange" solutions that contain long horizontal lines/bands of
  planning units (#205, #268).
- Update `add_contiguity_constraints()` and
  `add_feature_contiguity_constraints()` to be compatible with updates to
  the _igraph_ package.
- Update `write_problem()` so that it can use the _gurobi_ package to write
  problems (if desired). This substantially reduces run time, because writing
  problems using the _Rsymphony_ packages also requires solving them.

## Documentation updates

- Update publication record.

# prioritizr 8.0.3.5

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Update `presolve_check()` to throw warning if a problem has a single feature
  (#309). Thanks to Sandra Neubert (\@sandra-neubert) for code contribution.
- Update `print()` and `summary()` for `problem()` objects so that all
  text is printed at once (rather than sequentially).
- Fix `write_problem()` so that it works as expected (#312).
- Update `problem()`, `add_linear_constraints()`, `add_linear_penalties()`,
  `add_locked_in_constraints()`, `add_locked_out_constraints()`,
  `adjacency_matrix()`, `binary_stack()`, `category_layer()`,
  `connectivity_matrix()`,`fast_extract()`,  `intersecting_units()`,
  `proximity_matrix()`, `rij_matrix()`, `simulate_data()`,
  `simulate_species()`, `simulate_cost()`, and `zones()` and other functions so
  that they will throw an error if a categorical `terra::rast()` object is
  provided as an argument (#313). This is because categorical rasters are not
  supported. Thanks to Martin Jung (\@Martin-Jung) for bug report.
- Fix NAMESPACE issues related to registration of internal S3 methods.
- Fix bug with `problem()` not throwing multiple warnings with unusual data
  (e.g., given cost and feature data with negative values, previously
  only a single warning about negative costs would be thrown).
  Thanks to Sandra Neubert (\@sandra-neubert) for bug report.

## Notice

- CRAN release.

# prioritizr 8.0.2.7

## Notice

- We have developed a better approach for rescaling boundary data to
  avoid numerical issues during optimization (#297). Earlier versions of the
  package recommended the use of the `scales::rescale()` to rescale such data.
  However, we now realize that this approach can produce inconsistencies for
  boundary length data (e.g., the total perimeter of a planning unit might not
  necessarily equal the sum of the edge lengths). In some cases, these
  inconsistencies can cause solutions generated with high boundary
  penalties (i.e., using `add_boundary_penalties()` with a high `penalty`
  value) to contain a large reserve (i.e., a spatial cluster of selected of
  planning units) with a single unselected planning unit in the middle of the
  reserve. In the the worst case, these inconsistencies produce a situation
  where increasing boundary penalties (i.e., generating multiple solutions with
  `add_boundary_penalties()` and increasing `penalty` values)
  does not alter the spatial configuration of solutions. Although use of
  `scales::rescale()` did not produce such behavior prior to version 8.0.0,
  changes to the output format for `boundary_matrix()` in subsequent versions
  now mean that `scales::rescale()` can cause these issues. We now recommend
  using the new `rescale_matrix()` function to rescale boundary length data to
  avoid numerical issues, whilst also avoid such inconsistencies.

## New features

- New `rescale_matrix()` function to help with rescaling boundary length
  (e.g., generated using `boundary_matrix()`) and connectivity
  (e.g., generated using `connectivity_matrix()`) data so avoid
  numerical issues during optimization (#297). Thanks to
  Jason Flower (\@jflowernet) and Joan Giménez Verdugo for bug reports.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Update the `print()` and `summary()` methods for `problem()` objects
  so that they will now better describe situations when the planning cost
  data all contain a constant value (e.g., all costs equal to 1).

## Documentation updates

- Update examples and vignettes to use the `rescale_matrix()` function
  instead of the `scales::rescale()` function for rescaling boundary
  length and connectivity data (#297).
- Update publication record.

# prioritizr 8.0.2.6

## New features

- Update `add_neighbors_constraints()` so that it has an additional
  `clamp` argument so the minimum number of neighbors permitted for
  each planning unit in the solution is clamped to the number of neighbors that
  each planning unit has. For example, if a planning unit has 2 neighbors,
  `k = 3`, and `clamp = FALSE`, then the planning unit could not
  ever be selected in the solution. However, if `clamp = TRUE`, then
  the planning unit could potentially be selected in the solution if both of
  its 2 neighbors were also selected.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix issue with `problem()` that prevents `features` being supplied as
  a `data.frame` that contains feature names stored as a `factor` (#295).
  Thanks to Carl Boetigger (\@cboettig) for bug report.

## Documentation updates

- Fix URLs.

# prioritizr 8.0.2.5

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Update `problem()` so that it will throw a meaningful error message if the
  user accidentally specifies the geometry column for `sf` planning unit data
  as a feature.

# prioritizr 8.0.2.4

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix compatibility with updates to _terra_ package.
- Fix `rij_matrix()` so that it works when none of the raster layers being
  processed fit into memory (#290). Thanks to Edwards Marc (\@edwardsmarc) for
  bug report.
- Fix spatial extent of built-in raster datasets so that extents are between
  0 and 1 (i.e., `get_sim_pu_raster()`, `get_sim_locked_in_raster()`,
  `get_sim_locked_out_raster()`, `get_sim_zones_pu_raster()`,
  `get_sim_features()`, `get_sim_zones_features()`).
- Update `add_manual_locked_constraints()` and
  `add_manual_bounded_constraints()` so that the indices in the
  specified in the argument `data$pu` should consistently refer to the total
  units. In other words, the indices in `data$pu` should refer to the row
  numbers (for planning units in `sf` or `data.frame` format) or cell numbers
  (for planning units in `Raster` or `SpatRaster` format) of the planning units
  that should be locked.
- Fix warnings thrown due to package version comparisons.

## Documentation updates

- Update publication record.

# prioritizr 8.0.2.3

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Export `solve.ConservationProblem()` so that it can be called directly
  (#283). Thanks to Tin Buenafe (\@SnBuenafe) for bug report.

## Documentation updates

- Update publication record.

# prioritizr 8.0.2.2

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix compatibility with _highs_ package (version 0.1-10) (#281).

## Documentation updates

- Update publication record.

# prioritizr 8.0.2.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Update `problem()` so that an error will be thrown if argument to `features`
  contains only missing (`NA`) values (e.g., an _sf_ object is supplied that
  has `NA` values in all rows for a feature's column).

## Documentation updates

- Update publication record.

# prioritizr 8.0.2

## Notice

- The package has been updated to focus on using the _sf_ and _terra_ package
  for spatial vector and raster datasets. This is because the _sf_ package is
  the successor to the _sp_ package, and the _terra_ package is the successor
  to the _raster_ package. By leveraging these newer packages, the _prioritizr_
  package can provide better performance. Although _sp_ and _raster_ package
  classes (e.g., `raster::stack()` and `sp::SpatialPolyonsDataFrame()`)
  are still supported, the _prioritizr_ package will now throw deprecation
  warnings. Since support for the _sp_ and _raster_ package classes
  will be fully deprecated and removed in a later version this year, we
  recommend updating code to use the _sf_ and _terra_ packages.

## Major changes

- All _proto_ classes have been migrated to _R6_ classes. This update reduces
  memory usage (#238), so `problem()` objects can now contain many more
  constraints and penalties. Note that any `problem()` objects
  that were produced using earlier versions of the package are no longer
  compatible. Thanks to Jason Flower (\@jflowernet) for bug report on memory issues.
- The _proto_, _raster_, _sf_, _sp_ packages are no longer automatically
  loaded alongside _prioritizr_. As such, users will need to load them manually
  (e.g., using `library(sf)`).
- The built-in datasets have been removed and replaced with functions
  to import them as needed (i.e., `get_sim_pu_raster()`,
  `get_sim_pu_polygons()`, `get_sim_pu_lines()`, `get_sim_pu_points()`,,
  `get_sim_locked_in_raster()`, `get_sim_locked_out_raster()`,
  `get_sim_zones_pu_raster()`, `get_sim_zones_pu_polygons()`,
  `get_sim_phylogeny()`, `get_sim_features()`, `get_sim_zones_features()`).
  These functions now return `sf::st_sf()`,
  `terra::rast()`, `ape::read.tree()` and `zones()` objects.
  Note that these functions are provided because `data(...)` cannot be
  used with `terra::rast()` objects. See `?data` for more information.
- The `boundary_matrix()` output format has been updated. This means that
  users will not be able to use boundary data generated using previous
  versions of the package.
- The `add_lpsymphony_solver()` now throws an error, instead of a warning,
  if an old version of the _lpsymphony_ package is installed that is known
  to produce incorrect results.
- The `marxan_boundary_data_to_matrix()` function is no longer compatible
  with boundary data for multiple zones.
- The `distribute_load()` function has been deprecated, because it is no
  longer used. For equivalent functionality, See `parallel::splitIndices()`.
- The `new_optimization_problem()` and `predefined_optimization_problem()`
  functions have been superseded by the new `optimization_problem()` function.
- To simplify package documentation and functionality, the following functions
  are no longer exported: `is.Waiver()`, `add_default_decisions()`
  `new_id()`, `is.Id()`, `print.Id()`, `pproto()`.
- Updates to improve the error messages and error message handling.
  Hopefully, users should no longer see `"bad error message"`!

## New features

- The `print()` function for `problem()`, `optimization_problem()`, and
  `zones()` objects has been updated to provide more information.
- New `summary()` function to provide extensive detail on `problem()` objects.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug for `add_feature_weights()` when applied to problems with
  an `add_max_phylo_div_objective()` or `add_max_phylo_end_objectve()`.
  Specifically, the bug meant that weights weren't being applied to
  problems with these particular objectives.
- Fix instructions in `add_gurobi_solver()` documentation for opening vignette.
- Update solver functions to provide instructions for installing
  dependencies in error messages when their dependencies are not available.
- To ensure consistency among the portfolio functions, all of them (except for
  `add_extra_portfolio()`) default to generating 10 solutions.
- The `solve()` function will now output `tibble::tibble()` objects
  (instead of `data.frame()` objects), when the planning unit data are
  `tibble::tibble()` objects.
- The `boundary_matrix()` function now uses `terra::sharedPaths()` for
  calculations, providing greater performance (#257). Thanks to Jason Flower (\@jflowernet) for bug report.
- The `eval_ferrier_importance()` function can now be used with
  any objective function that uses targets and a single zone.
- Fix CRAN note regarding C++ standards (#263).
- Remove _doParallel_ and _plyr_ packages as dependencies by simplifying
  the `add_shuffle_portfolio()` and `eval_replacement_importance()` functions.
- Fix `add_linear_penalties()` function so that the penalty parameter is applied
  correctly (#342). In previous versions, this bug meant that solving a problem
  with `penalty = 1` would produce solution based on `penalty = -1` (and vice
  versa). Additionally, this bug also meant that compiling/solving a problem
  multiple times would cause the formulation to alternate between using
  `penalty = 1` and `penalty = -1`. Thanks to Carina Firkowski
  (\@Carina-Firkowski) for bug report.

  cause any issues, and (ii) provide recommendations for addressing issues.

## Documentation updates

- Update documentation for `add_min_largest_shortfall_objective()` so that
  examples complete in a shorter period of time.

# prioritizr 7.2.0.2

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in processing planning unit data when a problem is constructed
  using arguments to (i) `x` that are `numeric` or `matrix` format, (ii)
  `x` that contain missing (`NA`) values, and (iii) `rij_matrix` that
  are in `dgCMatrix` format. This bug only occurred when all three of these
  specific conditions were met. When it occurred, the bug caused planning units
  with `NA` cost values to receive very high cost values (e.g., 1e+300).
  This bug  meant that when attempting to solve the problem, the
  presolve checks (per `presolve_check()`) would throw an error complaining
  about very high cost values (#236). Thanks to \@lmathon for bug report.

# prioritizr 7.2.0.1

## Documentation updates

- Update publication record.

# prioritizr 7.2.0.0

## Major changes

- Update `add_connectivity_penalties()` function and documentation so that
  it is designed specifically for symmetric connectivity data.

## New features

- New `add_asym_connectivity_penalties()` function that is designed
  specifically for asymmetric connectivity data. This function has been
  created to help ensure that asymmetric connectivity data are handled
  correctly. For instance, using asymmetric connectivity data with
  `add_connectivity_penalties()` function in previous versions of the package
  sometimes resulted in the data being incorrectly treated as symmetric data.
  Additionally, this function uses an updated mathematical formulation
  for handling asymmetric connectivity so that it provides similar
  results to the _Marxan_ software (#223). Thanks to Nina Faure Beaulieu
  (\@ninzyfb) for bug report.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix `add_locked_in_constraints()` and `add_locked_out_constraints()`
  to ensure that a meaningful error message is provided when no planing
  units are locked (#234). Thanks to Alec Nelson (\@AlecNelson) for bug report.
- Fix `presolve_check()` so that it does not throw a meaningless warning
  when the mathematical objective function only contains zeros.
- Update `presolve_check()` to help reduce chances of mis-attributing
  high connectivity/boundary values due to planning unit costs.
- Update `marxan_problem()` function so that it can be used with asymmetric
  connectivity data. This is now possible because there are dedicated functions
  for symmetric and asymmetric connectivity.

  `add_lpsymphony_solver()` over `add_rsymphony_solver()`, and
  `add_cbc_solver()` over all open source solvers.

## Documentation updates

- Previous versions of the package reported that the `gap` parameter
  for the `add_rsymphony_solver()` and `add_lpsymphony_solver()` corresponded
  to the maximum absolute difference from the optimal objective value.
  This was an error due to misunderstanding the _SYMPHONY_ documentation.
  Under previous versions of the package, the `gap` parameter actually
  corresponded to a relative optimality gap expressed
  as a percentage (such that`gap = 10` indicates that solutions must be at
  least 10% from optimality). We have now fixed this error and the documentation
  described for the `gap` parameter is correct. We apologize for any
  inconvenience this may have caused.
- Update documentation for solvers to provide more detailed information.
- Update publication record.

  with `sf` planning unit data.

## Documentation updates

- Update Solution format section documentation for evaluation functions
  (i.e. all functions starting with `eval_`) to mention that
  the argument to `solution` should only contain columns that correspond to
  the solution (#176). Thanks to Phil Dyer (\@PhDyellow) for bug report.

  associated with a solution.
- New `eval_connectivity()` function to calculate the connectivity associated
  with a solution.

  feature is represented by a solution. This function is similar to the
  deprecated `eval_feature_representation()` function, except that it
  follows conventions for other evaluation functions (e.g. `eval_cost`).
- New `eval_target_representation()` function to assess how well each
  target is met by a solution. This function is similar to the
  `eval_feature_representation()`, except that it corresponds to the targets
  in a conservation planning problem.

## Major changes

- Rename `ferrier_score` function as `eval_ferrier_importance()` function for
  consistency.
- Rename `replacement_cost` function as `eval_replacement_importance()` function
  for consistency.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix target calculations in `add_loglinear_targets()` and
  `loglinear_interpolation()` functions. Previously they used a natural
  logarithm for log-linear interpolation. To follow target setting approaches
  outlined by Rodrigues et al. (2004), they now use the decadic logarithm (i.e.
  `log10()`).

## Documentation updates

- Update publication record vignette.

  `add_rsymphony_solver()` functions so that they will not return solutions with
  values less than zero or greater than one when solving problems with
  proportion-type decisions. This issue is the result of inconsistent precision
  when performing floating point arithmetic (#117). Thanks to Martin Jung
  (\@Martin-Jung) for bug report.
- Update `add_locked_in_constraints()` and `add_locked_out_constraints()`
  functions to provide a more helpful error message the `locked_in`/`locked_out`
  argument refers to a column with data that are not logical (i.e.
  `TRUE`/`FALSE`; #118). Thanks to Martin Jung (\@Martin-Jung) for bug report.

  (`NA`) cost data.

# prioritizr 4.0.4.1

## New features

- New `presolve_check()` function to investigate potential sources of numerical
  instability before trying to solve a problem. The manual entry for this
  function discusses common sources of numerical instability and approaches
  for fixing them.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The `solve()` function will now use the `presolve_check()` function to
  verify that problems do not have obvious sources of numerical instability
  before trying to solve them. If a problem is likely to have numerical
  instability issues then this function will now throw an error (unless
  the `solve(x, force = TRUE)`).
- The `add_rsymphony_solver()` function now uses sparse matrix formats so that
  attempts can be made to solve large problems with SYMPHONY---though it is
  unlikely that _SYMPHONY_ will be able to solve such problems in a feasible
  period of time.
- Fix warnings thrown by the _tibble_ package when calling
  `tibble::as.tibble()` instead of `tibble::as_tibble()`.

## Documentation updates

  `add_connectivity_penalties()` function (#106).

# prioritizr 4.0.2.14

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug where use of `add_rsymphony_solver()` and `add_lpsymphony_solver()`
  sometimes returned infeasible solutions when subjected to a
  time limit (#105). Thanks to \@magalicombes for bug report.

# prioritizr 4.0.2.13

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix assorted bugs in the render, setter, and getter parameter functions for
  `ConservationProblem-class` objects. These methods were implemented to be
  used in future interactive applications and are not currently used in the
  package. As a consequence, these bugs do not affect the correctness of
  any results.

# prioritizr 4.0.2.12

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix `bad error message` error being thrown when input rasters are not
  comparable (i.e. same coordinate reference system, extent, resolutions, and
  dimensionality) (#104). Thanks to \@faengl for bug report.

# prioritizr 4.0.2.8

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug where the `add_neighbor_constraints()` and
  `add_contiguity_constraints()` functions used more memory than they actually
  needed (#102). This is because the argument validation code converted sparse
  matrix objects (i.e. `dgCMatrix`) to base objects (i.e. `matrix`) class
  temporarily. This bug only meant inefficient utilization of computer
  resources---it did not affect the correctness of any results.

# prioritizr 4.0.2.7

## New feature
- New `add_mandatory_allocation_constraints()` function. This function can be
  used to ensure that every planning unit is allocated to a management zone in
  the solution. It is useful when developing land-use plans where every single
  parcel of land must be assigned to a specific land-use zone.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in the `$find(x)` method for `Collection` prototypes that caused
  it to throw an error incorrectly. This method was not used in earlier versions
  of this package.

## Documentation updates

- Add the `add_mandatory_allocation_constraints()` to the Management Zones and
  Prioritizr vignettes.

# prioritizr 4.0.2.6

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug the `feature_representation()` function that caused the "amount_held"
  column to have NA values instead of the correct values. This bug only
  affected problems with multiple zones.

# prioritizr 4.0.2.5

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in argument validation code for the `category_layer()` function that
  it this function to incorrectly throw an error claiming that the input
  argument to `x` was invalid when it was in fact valid. This bug is
  encountered when different layers the argument to `x` have non-NA values in
  different cells.

# prioritizr 4.0.2.4

## Documentation updates

- Update instructions for activating _Gurobi_ licenses on remote machines (#98).

# prioritizr 4.0.2.3

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The `add_contiguity_constraints()` function now uses sparse matrix formats
  internally for single-zone problems. This means that the constraints
  can be applied to single-zoned problem with many more planning units.

# prioritizr 4.0.2.2

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The `add_connectivity_penalties()` function now uses sparse matrix formats
  internally for single-zone problems. This means that connectivity penalties
  can be applied to single-zoned problem with many more planning units.

# prioritizr 4.0.2.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Update warning text when compiling problems that contain (i) objective
  functions that do not use targets and (ii) targets (#93).

## Documentation updates

- Update documentation for the `add_max_utility_objective()` and
  `add_max_cover_objective()` functions to make it clearer that they
  do not use targets (#94).

# prioritizr 4.0.2

## Notice

- Release candidate for CRAN.

# prioritizr 4.0.1.6

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in `add_locked_in_constraints()` and `add_locked_out_constraints()`
  that incorrectly threw an error when using `logical` locked data
  (i.e. `TRUE`/`FALSE`) because it incorrectly thought that valid inputs were
  invalid.
- Fix bug in `add_locked_in_constraints()`, `add_locked_out_constraints()`,
  and `add_manual_locked_constraints()` where solving the same problem object
  twice resulted in incorrect planning units being locked in or out of the
  solution (#92). Thanks to Javier Fajardo (\@javierfajnolla) for bug report.
- Added unit tests for objectives, constraints, decisions, targets, and
  penalties to ensure that solving problems twice does not result in
  different solutions.

# prioritizr 4.0.1.5

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in `feature_abundances()` that caused the solve function to throw an
  error when attempting to solve problems with a single feature.
- Fix bug in `add_cuts_portfolio()` that caused the portfolio to return
  solutions that were not within the specified optimality gap when using the
  _Gurobi_ solver.
- Add the ability to specify the search pool method and number of solutions to
  the `add_pool_portfolio()` function.

# prioritizr 4.0.1.4

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The `feature_representation()` function now allows `numeric` solutions with
  attributes (e.g. when output by the `solve()` function) when calculating
  representation statistics for problems with `numeric` planning unit data
  (#91). Thanks to Javier Fajardo (\@javierfajnolla) for bug report.
- The `add_manual_targets()` function threw a warning when some features had
  targets equal to zero. This resulted in an excessive amount of warnings. Now,
  warnings are thrown for targets that are less then zero.
- The `problem()` function sometimes incorrectly threw a warning that feature
  data had negative values when the data actually did not contain negative
  values. This has now been addressed.

# prioritizr 4.0.1.3

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The `problem` function now allows negative values in the cost and feature
  data (and throws a warning if such data are detected).
- The `add_absolute_targets()` and `add_manual_targets()` functions now allow
  negative targets (but throw a warning if such targets are specified).
- The `compile` function throws an error if a problem is compiled using
  the expanded formulation with negative feature data.
- The `add_absolute_targets()` function now throws an warning---instead of an
  error---if the specified targets are greater than the feature abundances
  in planning units to accommodate negative values in feature data.

# prioritizr 4.0.1.2

## Documentation updates

- Fix `add_max_cover_objective()` in _prioritizr_ vignette (#90).

# prioritizr 4.0.1.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The `add_loglinear_targets()` function now includes a `feature_abundances()`
  parameter for specifying the total amount of each feature to use when
  calculating the targets (#89). Thanks to Liz Law (\@lizlaw) for suggestion.

## Documentation updates

- The `add_relative_targets()` documentation now makes it clear that locked out
  planning units are included in the calculations for setting targets (#89).

# prioritizr 4.0.1

## Notice

- Release candidate for CRAN.

# prioritizr 4.0.0.12

## New feature

- New `feature_abundances()` function to calculate the total amount of each
  feature in the planning units (#86). Thanks to Javier Fajardo
  (\@javierfajnolla) for suggestion.

# prioritizr 4.0.0.11

## Documentation updates

- Fix some equations in the documentation (#83).

# prioritizr 4.0.0.10

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

# prioritizr 4.0.0.9

## Documentation updates

- Fix minor typos in the _Gurobi installation guide_.
- Update the _Management zones tutorial_.

# prioritizr 4.0.0.8

## Documentation updates

- Add instructions for setting up the _Gurobi_ Academic license on a computer
  that it is not connected to a university computer network using a computer
  that is on an academic network (#81). For example, these instructions could be
  used to set up _Gurobi_ on a cloud-based system using a laptop computer that
  is connected a university's wireless network.

# prioritizr 4.0.0.7

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The `add_cuts_portfolio()` function uses the _Gurobi_ solution pool to
  generate unique solutions within a specified gap of optimality when tasked
  with solving problems with _Gurobi_ (version 8.0.0+) (#80).

# prioritizr 4.0.0.6

## New features

- New `add_pool_portfolio()` function to generate a portfolio of solutions using
  the _Gurobi_ solution pool (#77).

# prioritizr 4.0.0.5

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The `boundary_matrix()` function now has the experimental functionality to
  use GEOS STR trees to speed up processing (#74).
- Solutions obtained from _Gurobi_ that contain binary-type decisions are
  explicitly rounded to the nearest integer. This is because _Gurobi_ can output
  solutions to binary problems that contain values which not exactly zero or
  one (e.g. 0.9999997 using default settings) (#78).

# prioritizr 4.0.0.4

## New features

- New `feature_representation()` function to how well features are represented
  in solutions (#73).

# prioritizr 4.0.0.3

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The _prioritizrdata_ package has been listed under Suggests.

## Documentation updates

- The vignettes in the _prioritizrdata_ package have been moved to this package
  to make them easier to find.

# prioritizr 4.0.0.2

# prioritizr 4.0.0.1

## Documentation updates

- Minor improvements to the documentation for the `problem()` function.

# prioritizr 4.0.0.0

## New features

- Added functionality to build and solve problems with multiple management
  zones (#14).
- New built-in datasets `sim_pu_zones_stack`, `sim_pu_zones_polygons`,
  and `sim_features_zones` for exploring conservation problems with
  multiple management zones.
- New `zones` function and `Zones` class to organize data with multiple
  zones.
- New `add_manual_targets()` function for creating targets that pertain to
  multiple management zones.
- New `add_manual_locked_constraints()` function to manually specify which
  planning units should or shouldn't be allocated to specific zones in
  solutions.
- New `binary_stack()`, `category_layer()`, and `category_vector()` functions
  have been provided to help work with data for multiple management zones.

## Major updates

- The `problem()` function now accepts `Zone` objects as arguments for
  `feature` to create problems with multiple zones.
- The `add_relative_targets()` and `add_absolute_targets()` functions for adding
  targets to problems can be used to specify targets for each feature in
  each zone.
- The `solve()` function now returns a `list` of solutions when generating
  a portfolio of solutions.
- All functions for adding constraints and penalties now have
  parameters that specify how they should treat planning units allocate to
  different zones (using the `zones` parameter) and specify how they
  they should be applied (using the `data` parameter. All of these functions
  have default arguments that mean that problems with a single zone
  should have the same optimal solution as problems created in the earlier
  version of the package.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- The `add_locked_in_constraints()` and `add_locked_out_constraints()`
  functions for specifying which planning units are locked in or out
  now accept `matrix` arguments for specifying which zones are locked
  in or out.
- The `add_feature_weights()` function can be used to weight different
  the representation of each feature in each zone.

## Documentation updates

- New _Management zones_ vignette on building and solving problems with
  multiple management zones.
- Added mention of zones functionality to package DESCRIPTION, summary (i.e.,
  `?prioritizr`), and README.
- The _Quick Start Guide_ and _Prioritizr Basics_ vignettes have been
  consolidated into the _prioritizr_ vignette.
- The `marxan_problem()` has been updated with more comprehensive documentation
  and to provide more helpful error messages. For clarity, it will now only
  work with tabular data in the standard _Marxan_ format.

- Fix bug where `add_locked_in_constraints()` and `add_locked_out_constraints()`
  throw an exception when used with semi-continuous-type decisions (#59).
- Error message in `compile()` thrown when the same planning unit is locked in
  and locked out now prints the planning unit indices in a readable format.

# prioritizr 3.0.3.4

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug where `add_locked_in_constraints()` and `add_locked_out_constraints()`
  are ignored when using proportion-type decisions (#58).

# prioritizr 3.0.3.3

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in `predefined_optimization_problem()` which incorrectly recognized
  some inputs as invalid when they were in fact valid.
- Addressed NOTE in `R CMD check` related to _proto_ package in Depends.

# prioritizr 3.0.3.2

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Moved _proto_ package from Imports to Depends in DESCRIPTION

# prioritizr 3.0.3.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Depends on R version 3.4.0 (avoids 'patchlevel 0' NOTE/WARNING in checks)

# prioritizr 3.0.3

## Notice

- Release candidate for CRAN.

  (partially addressing #40).
- Update `compile()` to work when no solvers are installed (#41).
- Gap arguments in `add_*_solvers` are now unbounded and can accept values
  larger than 1 (#44).

# prioritizr 3.0.1

## Notice

- Release candidate for CRAN.

# prioritizr 3.0.0.0

## Major changes
- The `add_max_cover_objective()` function has been renamed to the
  `add_max_utility_objective()`, because the formulation does not follow the
  historical formulation of the maximum coverage reserve selection problem
  (#38).
- The `add_max_cover_objective()` function now follows the historical maximum
  coverage objective. This fundamentally changes `add_max_cover_objective()`
  function and breaks compatibility with previous versions (#38).

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Update `add_lpsymphony_solver()` examples and tests to skip on Linux
  operating systems.
- Add tests to unit tests that were being skipped in new version of _testthat_

  causing the function to throw an error when the number of boundaries/edges is
  less than the number of planning units.

# prioritizr 2.0.2.6

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Makevars now compatible with Mac OSX Sierra (#33).

# prioritizr 2.0.2.5

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

## Documentation updates

- Rebuilt website and documentation.

# prioritizr 2.0.2.0

## Documentation updates

- Included vignette on Gurobi solver installation and testing.

# prioritizr 2.0.1.0

## Major changes

- Fixed bug where `Spatial*DataFrame` input to `marxan_problem()` would always
  use the first column in the attribute table for the cost data. **This bug is
  serious** so analysis that used `Spatial*DataFrame` inputs in
  `marxan_problem()` should be rerun.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Added functionality to use feature abundance/occurrence data stored as
  columns in the planning unit data when constructing `problem()` objects.

# prioritizr 2.0.0.2

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Skip `add_cuts_portfolio()` on Travis.

# prioritizr 2.0.0.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Skip `add_cuts_portfolio()` and `add_shuffle_portfolio()` tests on CRAN.

# prioritizr 2.0.0.0

## Major changes

- This version breaks compatibility with previous releases because
  solutions in `data.frame` and `Spatial*DataFrame` objects
  are now stored in columns named "solution_*" (e.g. "solution_1")

## Documentation updates

- Tidy examples in `add_gurobi_solver.R`, `add_lpsymphony_solver.R`,
  `add_rsymphony_solver.R`, and `solvers.R`.
  argument in `add_lpsymphony_solver()` and `add_rsymphony_solver()`.
- Assorted spelling mistakes have been fixed.

# prioritizr 1.0.2.3

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- `ConservationProblem$print()` now only prints the first three species names
  and a count of the total number of features. This update means that
  `ConservationProblem` objects with lots of features can now safely be printed
  without polluting the R console.
- Fix bug where _lpsymphony_ and _Rsymphony_ solvers would return solutions
  containing NA values if they did not find a feasible solution within
  the argument to `time_limit`.

## Documentation updates

- Attempt to make equations in help files prettier.

# prioritizr 1.0.2.2

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Update `marxan_problem()` to work with absolute file paths and the `INPUTDIR`
  in Marxan input files (#19). Thanks to Dan Rosauer (\@DanRosauer) for bug
  report.

# prioritizr 1.0.2.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in `solve()` when the rij data does not contain the highest planning
  unit identifier specified when building the `problem()` (#20).

# prioritizr 1.0.2.0

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Passes CRAN checks on Winbuilder.
- Added _roxygen2_ to Suggests for Travis CI.

# prioritizr 1.0.1.6

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Simplify vignette workflow. Vignettes can now be compiled by using
  `devtools::build_vignettes()`. Earlier versions needed the vignettes to be
  compiled using the _Makefile_ to copy files around to avoid tangled R code
  causing failures during R CMD CHECK. Although no longer needed, the vignettes
  can still be compiled using the shell command `make vigns` if
  desired.
- Make the _data.table_ package automatically installed when _prioritizr_ is
  installed (#18).
- Move _shiny_, _shinydashboard_, and _leaflet_ packages to Imports to avoid
  polluting users environment.
- Update preliminary versions of the shiny apps to call functions from other
  packages explicitly.
- Lint objective function definition files.
- Added _rmarkdown_ package to Suggests following recommended practices.

## Documentation updates

- The `README.Rmd` now lives in the top-level directory following standard
  practices. It should now be complied using `rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd")`
  or using the shell command `make readme`. Note that the figures for
  `README.md` can be found in the directory `man/figures`.
- The example for `prshiny` will now only be run if executed during an
  interactive R session. Prior to this R CMD CHECK would hang.
- UTF-8 math characters in vignettes have been replaced with with MathJax
  compatible latex expressions.
- R code in the vignettes has been linted to follow the package's style guide.
- Fix example in vignette `quick_start.Rmd` showing how to run
  `marxan_problem()` using input `data.frame()` objects.
- Fix bug in vignette `quick_start.Rmd` counting number of selected planning
  units
- `README.Rmd` tweaks to make it look prettier on website.
- Remove "\text" latex sequences from objective function definition files
  because CRAN doesn't support _amsmath_ extensions in equations.
- Update examples in objective function files to only show relevant objectives

# prioritizr 1.0.1.5

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Enable 64 bit Armadillo flag. This increases the maximum size of problems
  that can be solved.
- Disable bound-checks in Armadillo matrix operations. This should reduce
  processing time when running the `compile()` function.

# prioritizr 1.0.1.4

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bug in `problem.data.frame` that meant that it did not check for missing
  values in `rij$pu`.

# prioritizr 1.0.1.3

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

- Fix bugs `add_absolute_targets()` and add_relative_targets` related to their
  standardGeneric being incorrectly defined
- Reduce installation size using Dirk Eddelbuettel's awesome advice:
  http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2017/08/14#009_compact_shared_libraries
- Fix bug in `add_corridor_targets()` when argument  `connectivities` is a
  `list`. The elements in the list are assumed to be `dsCMatrix` objects
  (aka symmetric sparse matrices in a compressed format) and are coerced
  to `dgCMatrix` objects to reduce computational burden. There was a typo,
  however, and so the objects were coerced to `dgCmatrix` and not `dgCMatrix`.
  This evidently was ok in earlier versions of the _RcppArmadillo_ and/or
  _Matrix_ packages but not in the most recent versions.

# prioritizr 1.0.1.2
