The *prioritizr R* package uses integer linear programming (ILP)
techniques to provide a flexible interface for building and solving
conservation planning problems. It supports a broad range of objectives,
constraints, and penalties that can be used to custom-tailor
conservation planning problems to the specific needs of a conservation
planning exercise. Once built, conservation planning problems can be
solved using a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm
solvers. In contrast to the algorithms conventionally used to solve
conservation problems, such as heuristics or simulated annealing, the
exact algorithms used here are guaranteed to find optimal solutions.
Furthermore, conservation problems can be constructed to optimize the
spatial allocation of different management actions or zones, meaning
that conservation practitioners can identify solutions that benefit
multiple stakeholders. Finally, this package has the functionality to
read input data formatted for the *Marxan* conservation planning
program, and find much cheaper solutions in a much shorter period of
time than *Marxan*.

## Installation

The latest official version of the *prioritizr R* package can be
installed from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) using the following *R* code.

reports or publications, please [file an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/prioritizr/prioritizr/issues/new) so we can
add it to the record.

## Usage

Here we will provide a short example showing how the *prioritizr R*
package can be used to build and solve conservation problems. For
brevity, we will use one of the built-in simulated datasets that is
distributed with the package. First, we will load the *prioritizr R*
package.

``` r
# load package
library(prioritizr)
```

We will use the `sim_pu_polygons` object to represent our planning
units. Although the *prioritizr R* can support many different types of
planning unit data, here our planning units are represented as polygons
in a spatial vector format (i.e. `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`). Each
polygon represents a different planning unit and we have 90 planning
units in total. The attribute table associated with this dataset
contains information describing the acquisition cost of each planning
(“cost” column), and a value indicating if the unit is already located
in protected area (“locked\_in” column). Let’s explore the planning unit
data.

``` r
# load planning unit data
data(sim_pu_polygons)

# show the first 6 rows in the attribute table
head(sim_pu_polygons@data)
```

    ##       cost locked_in locked_out
    ## 1 215.8638     FALSE      FALSE
    ## 2 212.7823     FALSE      FALSE
    ## 3 207.4962     FALSE      FALSE
    ## 4 208.9322     FALSE       TRUE
    ## 5 214.0419     FALSE      FALSE
    ## 6 213.7636     FALSE      FALSE

``` r
# plot the planning units and color them according to acquisition cost
spplot(sim_pu_polygons, "cost", main = "Planning unit cost",
       xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
# plot the planning units and show which planning units are inside protected
# areas (colored in yellow)
spplot(sim_pu_polygons, "locked_in", main = "Planning units in protected areas",
       xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1))
```

Conservation features are represented using a stack of raster data
(i.e. `RasterStack` objects). A `RasterStack` represents a collection of
`RasterLayers` with the same spatial properties (i.e. spatial extent,
coordinate system, dimensionality, and resolution). Each `RasterLayer`
in the stack describes the distribution of a conservation feature.

In our example, the `sim_features` object is a `RasterStack` object that
contains 5 layers. Each `RasterLayer` describes the distribution of a
species. Specifically, the pixel values denote the proportion of
suitable habitat across different areas inside the study area. For a
given layer, pixels with a value of one are comprised entirely of
suitable habitat for the feature, and pixels with a value of zero
contain no suitable habitat.

``` r
# load feature data
data(sim_features)

# plot the distribution of suitable habitat for each feature
plot(sim_features, main = paste("Feature", seq_len(nlayers(sim_features))),
     nr = 2)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="800" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Let’s say that we want to develop a reserve network that will secure 15%
of the distribution for each feature in the study area for minimal cost.
In this planning scenario, we can either purchase all of the land inside
a given planning unit, or none of the land inside a given planning unit.
Thus we will create a new
[`problem`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/problem.html) that will use
a minimum set objective
([`add_min_set_objective`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_min_set_objective.html)),
with relative targets of 15%
([`add_relative_targets`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_relative_targets.html)),
binary decisions
([`add_binary_decisions`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_binary_decisions.html)),
and specify that we want to want optimal solutions from the best solver
installed on our system
([`add_default_solver`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_default_solver.html)).

``` r
# create problem
p1 <- problem(sim_pu_polygons, features = sim_features,
              cost_column = "cost") %>%
      add_min_set_objective() %>%
      add_relative_targets(0.15) %>%
      add_binary_decisions() %>%
      add_default_solver(gap = 0)
```

After we have built a
[`problem`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/problem.html), we can solve
it to obtain a solution. Since we have not specified the method used to
solve the problem, *prioritizr* will automatically use the best solver
currently installed. **It is strongly encouraged to install the [Gurobi
software suite and the *gurobi* *R* package to solve problems
quickly](https://www.gurobi.com/), for more information on this please
refer to the [Gurobi Installation
Guide](https://prioritizr.net/articles/gurobi_installation.html)**

``` r
# solve the problem
s1 <- solve(p1)
```

Although this solution adequately conserves each feature, it is
inefficient because it does not consider the fact some of the planning
units are already inside protected areas. Since our planning unit data
contains information on which planning units are already inside
protected areas (in the `"locked_in"` column of the attribute table), we
can add constraints to ensure they are prioritized in the solution
([`add_locked_in_constraints`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_locked_in_constraints.html)).

``` r
# create new problem with locked in constraints added to it
p2 <- p1 %>%
      add_locked_in_constraints("locked_in")

# solve the problem
s2 <- solve(p2)

This solution is an improvement over the previous solution. However, it
is also highly fragmented. As a consequence, this solution may be
associated with increased management costs and the species in this
scenario may not benefit substantially from this solution due to edge
effects. We can further modify the problem by adding penalties that
punish overly fragmented solutions
([`add_boundary_penalties`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_boundary_penalties.html)).
Here we will use a penalty factor of 300 (i.e. boundary length modifier;
BLM), and an edge factor of 50% so that planning units that occur outer
edge of the study area are not overly penalized.

``` r
# create new problem with boundary penalties added to it
p3 <- p2 %>%
      add_boundary_penalties(penalty = 300, edge_factor = 0.5)

# solve the problem
s3 <- solve(p3)

This solution is even better then the previous solution. However, we are
not finished yet. This solution does not maintain connectivity between
reserves, and so species may have limited capacity to disperse
throughout the solution. To avoid this, we can add contiguity
constraints
([`add_contiguity_constraints`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_contiguity_constraints.html)).

``` r
# create new problem with contiguity constraints
p4 <- p3 %>%
      add_contiguity_constraints()

# solve the problem

Now let’s explore which planning units selected in the prioritization
are most important for meeting our targets as cost-effectively as
possible. To achieve this, we will calculate importance
(irreplaceability) scores using a version of the replacement cost
method. Under this method, planning units with higher scores are more
important for meeting the objective of our conservation planning problem
than those with lower scores. Furthermore, planning units with infinite
scores are irreplaceable—it is impossible to meet our targets without
protecting these planning units. Note that we override the solver
behavior in the code below to prevent lots of unnecessary text from
being output.

``` r
# solve the problem
rc <- p4 %>%
      add_default_solver(gap = 0, verbose = FALSE) %>%
      eval_replacement_importance(s4[, "solution_1"])
```

    ## Warning in res(x, ...): overwriting previously defined solver

``` r
# set infinite values as 1.09 so we can plot them
rc$rc[rc$rc > 100] <- 1.09

# plot the importance scores
# planning units that are truly irreplaceable are shown in red
spplot(rc, "rc", main = "Irreplaceability", xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1),
       ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1), at = c(seq(0, 0.9, 0.1), 1.01, 1.1),
       col.regions = c("#440154", "#482878", "#3E4A89", "#31688E", "#26828E",
                       "#1F9E89", "#35B779", "#6DCD59", "#B4DE2C", "#FDE725",

This short example demonstrates how the *prioritizr R* package can be
used to build a minimal conservation problem, how constraints and
penalties can be iteratively added to the problem to obtain a solution,
and how importance scores can be calculated for the solution to identify
critical places. Although we explored just a few different functions for
modifying the a conservation problem, the *prioritizr R* package
provides many functions for specifying objectives, constraints,
penalties, and decision variables, so that you can build and
custom-tailor a conservation planning problem to suit your exact
planning scenario.
