\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object.}

\item{zones}{\code{matrix} or \code{Matrix} object describing the
connection scheme for different zones. Each row and column corresponds
to a different zone in the argument to \code{x}, and cell values must
contain binary \code{numeric} values (i.e., one or zero) that indicate
if connected planning units (as specified in the argument to
\code{data}) should be still considered connected if they are allocated to
different zones. The cell values along the diagonal
of the matrix indicate if planning units should be subject to
contiguity constraints when they are allocated to a given zone. Note
arguments to \code{zones} must be symmetric, and that a row or column has
a value of one then the diagonal element for that row or column must also
have a value of one. The default argument to \code{zones} is an identity
matrix (i.e., a matrix with ones along the matrix diagonal and zeros
elsewhere), so that planning units are only considered connected if they
are both allocated to the same zone.}

\item{data}{\code{NULL}, \code{matrix}, \code{Matrix}, \code{data.frame}
object showing which planning units are connected with each
other. The argument defaults to \code{NULL} which means that the
connection data is calculated automatically using the
\code{\link[=adjacency_matrix]{adjacency_matrix()}} function.
See the Data format section for more information.}
}
\value{
An updated \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object with the constraints added to it.
}
\description{
Add constraints to a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} to ensure
that all selected planning units are spatially connected with each other
and form a single contiguous unit.
}
\details{
This function uses connection data to identify solutions that
form a single contiguous unit. It was inspired by the
mathematical formulations detailed in Önal and Briers (2006).
}
\section{Data format}{


The argument to \code{data} can be specified using the following formats.

\describe{

\item{\code{data} as a \code{NULL} value}{indicating that connection data should be
calculated automatically using the \code{\link[=adjacency_matrix]{adjacency_matrix()}} function.
This is the default argument.
Note that the connection data must be manually defined
using one of the other formats below when the planning unit data
in the argument to \code{x} is not spatially referenced (e.g.,
in \code{data.frame} or \code{numeric} format).}

\item{\code{data} as a \code{matrix}/\code{Matrix} object}{where rows and columns represent
different planning units and the value of each cell indicates if the
two planning units are connected or not. Cell values should be binary
\code{numeric} values (i.e., one or zero). Cells that occur along the
matrix diagonal have no effect on the solution at all because each
planning unit cannot be a connected with itself.}

\item{\code{data} as a \code{data.frame} object}{containing the fields (columns)
\code{"id1"}, \code{"id2"}, and \code{"boundary"}. Here, each row
denotes the connectivity between two planning units following the
\emph{Marxan} format. The field \code{boundary} should contain
binary \code{numeric} values that indicate if the two planning units
specified in the fields \code{"id1"} and \code{"id2"} are connected
or not. This data can be used to describe symmetric or
asymmetric relationships between planning units. By default,
input data is assumed to be symmetric unless asymmetric data is
also included (e.g., if data is present for planning units 2 and 3, then
the same amount of connectivity is expected for planning units 3 and 2,
unless connectivity data is also provided for planning units 3 and 2).}

In early versions, this function was named as the
