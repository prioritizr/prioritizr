\description{
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a feature's
distribution that should (ideally) be covered (represented) by a solution.

\strong{Please note that most objectives require targets, and attempting
to solve a problem that requires targets will throw an error.}

A variety of functions can be used to specify targets for a
conservation planning problem. Below we describe them in detail.

The \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} function can be used to add targets directly
to a conservation planning problem. It provides a flexible interface
for specifying targets based on a single method, or a combination
of methods. For example, it could be used to set targets
for all features in problem \code{x} based on Jung \emph{et al.} (2021) with
the following code:
\code{x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = jung_targets())}.
Additionally, if \code{x} had three features -- with the first feature
corresponding to an ecosystem and the latter two to different species --
this function could be used to set targets for the ecosystem feature based
on 30\% of its geographic distribution and
targets for the species features based on Polak \emph{et al.} 2015 with
the following code:
\verb{x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = list(relative_targets(0.3), jung_targets(), jung_targets())}.
Note that this function is specifically designed for problems with a single
zone, and cannot be used for multiple zones. In particular, the following
functions can be used to specify targets in conjunction with
\code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} function.

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=relative_targets]{relative_targets()}}}{
Specify targets as a proportion (between 0 and 1) of the total amount of each
feature in the the study area.
}

\item{\code{\link[=absolute_targets]{absolute_targets()}}}{
Specify targets that denote the minimum amount of each feature required in
the prioritization.
}

\item{\code{\link[=polak_targets]{polak_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Polak \emph{et al.} (2015).
This method was designed to set targets for species in national-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=ward_targets]{ward_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Watson \emph{et al.} (2005).
This method was designed to set targets for species in national-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=watson_targets]{watson_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Watson \emph{et al.} (2010).
This method was designed to set targets for species in national-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=jung_targets]{jung_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Jung \emph{et al.} (2021).
This method was designed to set targets for species in global-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=rodrigues_targets]{rodrigues_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Rodrigues \emph{et al.} (2004).
This method was designed to set targets for species in global-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=rl_species_targets]{rl_species_targets()}}}{
Specify targets based on criteria from the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of
Threatened Species (IUCN 2025).
}

\item{\code{\link[=rl_ecosystem_targets]{rl_ecosystem_targets()}}}{
Specify targets based on criteria from the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of
Ecosystems (IUCN 2024).
}
}

In addition to \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}, the following functions can also be
used to add targets directly to a conservation planning problem.
These functions are provided as convenient alternatives to using
the \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} function when the targets for all features
should be specified following the same method. For example,
if the targets for all features in the problem \code{x} should be set following
Rodrigues \emph{et al.} (2004), then this could be accomplished with
\code{x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = rodrigues_targets())} or
\code{x \%>\% add_rodrigues_targets()}.

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=add_relative_targets]{add_relative_targets()}}}{

\item{\code{\link[=add_absolute_targets]{add_absolute_targets()}}}{

\item{\code{\link[=add_polak_targets]{add_polak_targets()}}}{

The \code{\link[=add_manual_targets]{add_manual_targets()}} function can be used to set customized targets.
In particular, it is especially useful when setting targets for
problems that contain multiple zones. It can also be used
to customize how the target threshold should be applied (i.e., the
constraint sense). In addition to specifying that feature representation
should ideally be greater than or equal to a target threshold, this function
can be used to specify that feature representation should ideally
be smaller than or equal to, or equal to, a target threshold.
