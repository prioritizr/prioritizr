\description{
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a feature's
distribution that should (ideally) be covered (represented) by a solution.

\strong{Please note that most objectives require targets, and attempting
to solve a problem that requires targets will throw an error.}

A variety of functions can be used to specify targets for a
conservation planning problem. Below we describe them in detail.

The \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} function can be used to add targets
to a conservation planning problem. It provides a flexible interface
for specifying targets based on a single method, or a combination
of methods.
Note that this function is specifically designed for problems that have a
single zone, and cannot be used for problems that have multiple zones.
For example, given problem \code{x}, it could be used to specify
targets for all features calculated following Jung \emph{et al.} (2021) with
the following code.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# specify targets based on default parameters via method name
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = "jung")

# specify targets based on default parameters via function
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = spec_jung_targets())

# specify targets based on customized parameters via function
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = spec_jung_targets(prop_uplift = 0.05))
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Additionally, if \code{x} had three features -- with the first feature
corresponding to an ecosystem and the latter two to different species --
this function could be used to specify a target for the ecosystem feature
based on Polak \emph{et al.} (2015) and
targets for the species features based on Jung \emph{et al.} (2021) with
the following code.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# specify target setting methods for each feature with default parameters
# via method name
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(
  method = list("polak", "jung", "jung")
)

# specify target setting methods for each feature with customized parameters
# via functions
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(
  method = list(
    spec_polak_targets(),
    spec_jung_targets(prop_uplift = 0.05),
    spec_jung_targets(prop_uplift = 0.07)
  )
)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

The following functions can be used to specify targets in conjunction with
the \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} function. Note that some of these functions
do not have default parameters for all arguments and, as such, cannot be
specified using their name (e.g., \code{method = "relative"} will
not work because \code{\link[=spec_relative_targets]{spec_relative_targets()}} requires the user to specify
an argument for the \code{targets} parameter).

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=spec_relative_targets]{spec_relative_targets()}}}{
Specify targets as a proportion (between 0 and 1) of the total amount of each
feature in the the study area.
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_absolute_targets]{spec_absolute_targets()}}}{
Specify targets that denote the minimum amount of each feature required in
the prioritization.
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_interp_absolute_targets]{spec_interp_absolute_targets()}}}{
Specify targets based on an interpolation procedure between thresholds
calculated as the sum of the features values.
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_interp_area_targets]{spec_interp_area_targets()}}}{
Specify targets based on an interpolation procedure between area-based
thresholds.
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_rule_targets]{spec_rule_targets()}}}{
Add targets calculated following a rule-based procedure based on a set of
ecological and ecosystem criteria. This is a customizable version of the
approach in Harris and Holness (2023).
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_polak_targets]{spec_polak_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Polak \emph{et al.} (2015).
This method was designed to set targets for species in national-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_ward_targets]{spec_ward_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Watson \emph{et al.} (2005).
This method was designed to set targets for species in national-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_watson_targets]{spec_watson_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Watson \emph{et al.} (2010).
This method was designed to set targets for species in national-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_jung_targets]{spec_jung_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Jung \emph{et al.} (2021).
This method was designed to set targets for species in global-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_rodrigues_targets]{spec_rodrigues_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Rodrigues \emph{et al.} (2004).
This method was designed to set targets for species in global-scale
prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_rl_species_targets]{spec_rl_species_targets()}}}{
Specify targets based on criteria from the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of
Threatened Species (IUCN 2025).
}

\item{\code{\link[=spec_rl_ecosystem_targets]{spec_rl_ecosystem_targets()}}}{
Specify targets based on criteria from the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of
Ecosystems (IUCN 2024).
}
}

The \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}} function provides a convenient interface
for adding targets to a conservation planning problem. By assigning each
feature to a group and then specifying a target setting method for each
group, it can be used to assign targets for features based on different
target setting methods.
This function is designed to be used in conjunction with the previously
described functions specifying targets for the \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
function (e.g., \code{\link[=spec_relative_targets]{spec_relative_targets()}}, \code{\link[=spec_absolute_targets]{spec_absolute_targets()}},
\code{\link[=spec_jung_targets]{spec_jung_targets()}}).
Note that this function is specifically designed for problems that have a
single zone, and cannot be used for problems that have multiple zones.
For example, if the problem \code{x} had three features -- with the first feature
corresponding to an ecosystem and the latter two to different species --
this function could be used to set targets for the ecosystem feature based
on Polak \emph{et al.} (2015) and
targets for the species features based on Jung \emph{et al.} (2021) with
the following code.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# specify target setting methods for groups with default parameters
# via method names
x \%>\% add_group_targets(
  group = c("eco", "spp", "spp"),
  list(eco = "polak", spp = "jung")
)

# specify target setting methods for groups with default parameters
# via functions
x \%>\% add_group_targets(
  group = c("eco", "spp", "spp"),
  list(eco = spec_polak_targets(), spp = spec_jung_targets())
)

# specify target setting methods for groups with customized parameters
# via functions
x \%>\% add_group_targets(
  group = c("eco", "spp", "spp"),
  list(
    eco = spec_polak_targets(),
    spp = spec_jung_targets(prop_uplift = 0.05)
  )
)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

A set of functions are available for adding targets directly to a
conservation planning problem.
These functions are especially useful when target thresholds have
been pre-computed, or when considering problems that have multiple zones.
In particular, the following functions are available.

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=add_relative_targets]{add_relative_targets()}}}{
Add targets as a proportion (between 0 and 1) of the total amount of each
feature in the the study area
(i.e., where a value of 1 is equivalent to 100\%).
}

\item{\code{\link[=add_absolute_targets]{add_absolute_targets()}}}{
Add targets that denote the minimum amount of each feature held by the
prioritization.
}

\item{\code{\link[=add_manual_targets]{add_manual_targets()}}}{
Add targets by manually specifying the target setting information.
This function is especially useful for problems that
have multiple zones because it can be used to specify, for a given
feature, which zone -- or combination of zones -- should be considered for
assessing feature representation.
In addition to specifying targets where feature representation
should ideally be greater than or equal to target thresholds (i.e., as is
the case for all other target setting functions), this function provides
the functionality to specify targets where feature representation should be
smaller than or equal to -- or equal to -- target thresholds
(i.e., the constraint sense for the target).
