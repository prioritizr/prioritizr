\description{
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a feature's
distribution that should (ideally) be covered (represented) by a solution.

\strong{Please note that most objectives require targets, and attempting
to solve a problem that requires targets will throw an error.}

A variety of functions can be used to specify targets for a
conservation planning problem. Below we describe them in detail.

The \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} function can be used to add targets
to a conservation planning problem. It provides a flexible interface
for specifying targets based on a single method, or a combination
of methods.
Note that this function is specifically designed for problems that have a
single zone, and cannot be used for problems that have multiple zones.
For example, given problem \code{x}, it could be used to specify
targets for all features calculated following Jung \emph{et al.} (2021) with
the following code.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# specify targets based on default parameters via method name
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = "jung")

# specify targets based on default parameters via function
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = jung_targets())

# specify targets based on customized parameters via function
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = jung_targets(prop_uplift = 0.05))
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Additionally, if \code{x} had three features -- with the first feature
corresponding to an ecosystem and the latter two to different species --
this function could be used to specify a target for the ecosystem feature
based on Polak \emph{et al.} (2015) and
targets for the species features based on Jung \emph{et al.} (2021) with
the following code.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# specify target setting methods for each feature with default parameters
# via method name
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(
  method = list("polak", "jung", "jung")
)

# specify target setting methods for each feature with customized parameters
# via functions
x \%>\% add_auto_targets(
  method = list(
    polak_targets(),
    jung_targets(prop_uplift = 0.05),
    jung_targets(prop_uplift = 0.07)
  )
)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

The following functions can be used to specify targets in conjunction with
the \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} function. Note that some of these functions
do not have default parameters for all arguments and, as such, cannot be
specified using their name (e.g., \code{method = "relative"} will
not work because \code{\link[=relative_targets]{relative_targets()}} requires the user to specify
an argument for the \code{targets} parameter).

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=relative_targets]{relative_targets()}}}{
Specify targets as a proportion (between 0 and 1) of the total amount of each
feature in the the study area.
}

\item{\code{\link[=absolute_targets]{absolute_targets()}}}{

the prioritization.
}

\item{\code{\link[=interpolated_absolute_targets]{interpolated_absolute_targets()}}}{

calculated as the sum of the features values.
}

\item{\code{\link[=interpolated_area_targets]{interpolated_area_targets()}}}{

}

\item{\code{\link[=rule_targets]{rule_targets()}}}{

approach in Harris and Holness (2023).
}

\item{\code{\link[=polak_targets]{polak_targets()}}}{
Specify targets following Polak \emph{et al.} (2015).

prioritizations.
}

\item{\code{\link[=ward_targets]{ward_targets()}}}{

\item{\code{\link[=rodrigues_targets]{rodrigues_targets()}}}{

\item{\code{\link[=rl_species_targets]{rl_species_targets()}}}{

}

\item{\code{\link[=rl_ecosystem_targets]{rl_ecosystem_targets()}}}{
Specify targets based on criteria from the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of
Ecosystems (IUCN 2024).
}
}

The \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}} function provides a convenient interface
for adding targets to a conservation planning problem. By assigning each
feature to a group and then specifying a target setting method for each
group, it can be used to assign targets for features based on different
target setting methods.
This function is designed to be used in conjunction with the previously
described functions specifying targets for the \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
function (e.g., \code{\link[=relative_targets]{relative_targets()}}, \code{\link[=absolute_targets]{absolute_targets()}},
\code{\link[=jung_targets]{jung_targets()}}).
Note that this function is specifically designed for problems that have a
single zone, and cannot be used for problems that have multiple zones.
For example, if the problem \code{x} had three features -- with the first feature
corresponding to an ecosystem and the latter two to different species --
this function could be used to set targets for the ecosystem feature based
on Polak \emph{et al.} (2015) and
targets for the species features based on Jung \emph{et al.} (2021) with
the following code.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# specify target setting methods for groups with default parameters
# via method names
x \%>\% add_group_targets(
  group = c("eco", "spp", "spp"),
  list(eco = "polak", spp = "jung")
)

# specify target setting methods for groups with default parameters
# via functions
x \%>\% add_group_targets(
  group = c("eco", "spp", "spp"),
  list(eco = polak_targets(), spp = jung_targets())
)

# specify target setting methods for groups with customized parameters
# via functions
x \%>\% add_group_targets(
  group = c("eco", "spp", "spp"),
  list(eco = polak_targets(), spp = jung_targets(prop_uplift = 0.05))
)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

A set of functions are available for adding targets to a conservation
planning problem based on a particular method.
These functions are especially useful when all features should have
their targets calculated following the same method, and the default
parameters for the method need to be customized.
Note that these functions are specifically designed for problems that have a
single zone, and cannot be used for problems that have multiple zones.
For example, given problem \code{x}, then following code could be used to specify
that all features should have their targets calculated following
Rodrigues \emph{et al.} (2004).

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# specify the same target setting method for all features with default
# parameters via method name

# note that this is the same as:
# x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = rodrigues_target())
# x \%>\% add_auto_targets(method = "rodrigues")

x \%>\% add_rodrigues_targets()

# specify the same target setting method for all features with customized
# parameters

# note that this is the same as:
# x \%>\% add_auto_targets(
#   method = rodrigues_target(cap_threshold = 1e5)
# )

x \%>\% add_rodrigues_targets(cap_threshold = 1e5)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

}

Finally, the \code{\link[=add_manual_targets]{add_manual_targets()}} function provides an interface
for adding highly customized targets to a conservation planning problem.
Although this function can be used with problems that have a single
zone, it is especially useful when setting targets for
problems that have multiple zones.
This is because it can be used to specify, for a given target, which
zone -- or combination of zones -- should be considered for assessing
feature representation.
Furthermore, in addition to specifying targets where feature representation
should ideally be greater than or equal to target thresholds (i.e., as is
the case for all other target setting functions), this function provides
the functionality to specify targets where feature representation should be
smaller than or equal to -- or equal to -- target thresholds
(i.e., the constraint sense for the target).
