\title{Add a \emph{SYMPHONY} solver with \emph{lpsymphony}}
\usage{
add_lpsymphony_solver(
  x,
  gap = 0.1,
  time_limit = .Machine$integer.max,
  first_feasible = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} or \code{\link[=multi_problem]{multi_problem()}} object.}

\item{gap}{\code{numeric} gap to optimality. This gap is relative
and expresses the acceptable deviance from the optimal objective.
For example, a value of 0.01 will result in the solver stopping when
it has found a solution within 1\% of optimality.
Additionally, a value of 0 will result in the solver stopping
when it has found an optimal solution.
The default value is 0.1 (i.e., 10\% from optimality).}

\item{time_limit}{\code{numeric} time limit (seconds) for generating solutions.
The solver will return the current best solution when this time limit is
exceeded. The default value is the largest integer value
(i.e., \code{.Machine$integer.max}), effectively meaning that solver
will keep running until a solution within the optimality gap is found.}

\item{first_feasible}{\code{logical} should the first feasible solution be
be returned? If \code{first_feasible} is set to \code{TRUE}, the solver
will return the first solution it encounters that meets all the
constraints, regardless of solution quality. Note that the first feasible
solution is not an arbitrary solution, rather it is derived from the
relaxed solution, and is therefore often reasonably close to optimality.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} should information be printed while solving
optimization problems? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An updated \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object with the solver added to it.

\description{
Specify that the \href{https://github.com/coin-or/SYMPHONY}{\emph{SYMPHONY}}
software -- using the \pkg{lpsymphony} package --
should be used to solve a conservation planning problem
(Ralphs & Güzelsoy 2005).
This function can also be used to customize the behavior of the solver.
It requires the \pkg{lpsymphony} package to be installed
(see below for installation instructions).
}
\details{
\href{https://github.com/coin-or/SYMPHONY}{\emph{SYMPHONY}} is an
open-source mixed integer programming solver that is part of the
Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR) project.
This solver is provided because it may be easier to install
on some systems than the \pkg{Rsymphony} package. Additionally --
although the \pkg{lpsymphony} package doesn't provide the functionality
to specify the number of threads for solving a problem -- the
\pkg{lpsymphony} package will solve problems using parallel processing
(unlike the \pkg{Rsymphony} package). As a consequence, this
solver will likely generate solutions much faster than the
\code{\link[=add_rsymphony_solver]{add_rsymphony_solver()}}.
Although formal benchmarks examining the performance of this solver
have yet to be completed,
please see Schuster \emph{et al.} (2020) for benchmarks comparing the
run time and solution quality of the \pkg{Rsymphony} solver.

\section{Installation}{

The \pkg{lpsymphony} package is
distributed through
\href{https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.lpsymphony}{Bioconductor}.
To install the \pkg{lpsymphony} package, please use the following code:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_bioc("lpsymphony")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# load data
sim_pu_raster <- get_sim_pu_raster()
sim_features <- get_sim_features()

# create problem
p <-
  problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
  add_min_set_objective() \%>\%
  add_relative_targets(0.05) \%>\%
  add_proportion_decisions() \%>\%
  add_lpsymphony_solver(time_limit = 5, verbose = FALSE)

# generate solution
s <- solve(p)

# plot solution
plot(s, main = "solution", axes = FALSE)
}
