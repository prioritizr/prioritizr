\title{Add a SYMPHONY solver with lpsymphony}
\usage{
add_lpsymphony_solver(x, gap = 0.1, time_limit = -1, first_feasible = 0,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.}

\item{gap}{\code{numeric} gap to optimality. This gap is absolute and
expresses the acceptable deviance from the optimal objective. For example,
solving a minimum set objective problem with a gap of 5 will cause the
solver to terminate when the cost of the solution is within 5 cost units
from the optimal solution.}

\item{time_limit}{\code{numeric} time limit in seconds to run the optimizer.
The solver will return the current best solution when this time limit is
exceeded.}

\item{first_feasible}{\code{logical} should the first feasible solution be
be returned? If \code{first_feasible} is set to \code{TRUE}, the solver
will return the first solution it encounters that meets all the
constraints, regardless of solution quality. Note that the first feasible
solution is not an arbitrary solution, rather it is derived from the
relaxed solution, and is therefore often reasonably close to optimality.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} should information be printed while solving
optimization problems? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object with the solver added
  to it.

\description{
Specify the use of a SYMPHONY algorithm to solve a
\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object. Requires the
\emph{lpsymphony} package.
}
\details{
The \emph{lpsymphony} package provides a different interface to the
  COIN-OR software suite. Unlike the \emph{Rsymhpony} package, the
  \emph{lpsymphony} package is distributed through
  \href{https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.lpsymphony}{Bioconductor}.
  On Windows and Mac OSX, \emph{lpsymphony} may be easier to install. This
  solver uses the \emph{lpsymphony} package to solve problems.
