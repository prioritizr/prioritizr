\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}}, \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}}, \code{data.frame}, \code{matrix}, or
\code{numeric} vector specifying the planning units to use in the reserve
design exercise and their corresponding cost. It may be desirable to
exclude some planning units from the analysis, for example those outside
the study area. To exclude planning units, set the cost for those raster
cells to \code{NA}, or use the \code{\link[=add_locked_out_constraints]{add_locked_out_constraints()}} function.}

\item{features}{The feature data can be specified in a variety of ways.
The specific formats that can be used depend on the cost data format (i.e.,
argument to \code{x}) and whether the problem should have a single zone or
multiple zones. If the problem should have a single zone, then the feature
data can be specified following:

\describe{

\item{\strong{\code{x} has \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} planning units}}{
The argument to \code{features} can be a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}}
object showing the distribution of conservation features. Missing
values (i.e., \code{NA} values) can be used to indicate the absence of
a feature in a particular cell instead of explicitly setting these
cells to zero. Note that this argument type for \code{features} can
only be used to specify data for problems involving a single zone.}

\item{\strong{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or \code{data.frame} planning units}}{
The argument to \code{features} can be a \code{character} vector
with column names (from \code{x}) that correspond to the abundance or
occurrence of different features in each planning unit. Note that
this argument type can only be used to create problems involving a
single zone.}

\item{\strong{\code{x} has \code{data.frame}, \code{matrix}, or \code{numeric} vector planning
units}}{
The argument to \code{features} can be a \code{data.frame} object
containing the names of the features. Note that if this
type of argument is supplied to \code{features} then the argument
\code{rij} or \code{rij_matrix} must also be supplied. This type of
argument should follow the conventions used by \emph{Marxan}, wherein
each row corresponds to a different feature. It must also contain the
following columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{\code{integer} unique identifier for each feature
These identifiers are used in the argument to \code{rij}.}
\item{name}{\code{character} name for each feature.}
\item{prop}{\code{numeric} relative target for each feature
(optional).}
\item{amount}{\code{numeric} absolute target for each
feature (optional).}
}
}

}

If the problem should have multiple zones, then the feature
data can be specified following:

\describe{

\item{\strong{\code{x} has \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} planning units}}{
The argument to \code{features} can be a \code{\link[=zones]{ZonesRaster}}
object showing the distribution of conservation features in multiple
zones. As above, missing values (i.e., \code{NA} values) can be used to
indicate the absence of a feature in a particular cell instead of
explicitly setting these cells to zero.}

\item{\strong{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or \code{data.frame} planning units}}{
The argument to \code{features} can be a \code{\link[=zones]{ZonesCharacter}}
object with column names (from \code{x}) that correspond to the abundance or
occurrence of different features in each planning unit in different
zones.}

}}

\item{...}{not used.}

\item{run_checks}{\code{logical} flag indicating whether checks should be
run to ensure the integrity of the input data. These checks are run by
default; however, for large datasets they may increase run time. If it is
taking a prohibitively long time to create the prioritization problem,
try setting \code{run_checks} to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{cost_column}{\code{character} name or \code{integer} indicating the
column(s) with the cost data. This argument must be supplied when the
argument to \code{x} is a \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or
\code{data.frame} object. This argument should contain the name of each
column containing cost data for each management zone when creating
problems with multiple zones. To create a problem with a single zone, then
set the argument to \code{cost_column} as a single column name.}

\item{rij}{\code{data.frame} containing information on the amount of
each feature in each planning unit assuming each management zone. Similar
to \code{data.frame} arguments for \code{features}, the \code{data.frame}
objects must follow the conventions used by \emph{Marxan}. Note that the
\code{"zone"} column is not needed for problems involving a single
management zone. Specifically, the argument should contain the following
columns:
\describe{
\item{pu}{\code{integer} planning unit identifier.}
\item{species}{\code{integer} feature identifier.}
\item{zone}{\code{integer} zone identifier (optional for
problems involving a single zone).}
\item{amount}{\code{numeric} amount of the feature in the
planning unit.}
}}

\item{zones}{\code{data.frame} containing information on the zones. This
argument is only used when argument to \code{x} and \code{features} are
both \code{data.frame} objects and the problem being built contains
multiple zones. Following conventions used in \code{MarZone}, this
argument should contain the following columns:
columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{\code{integer} zone identifier.}
\item{name}{\code{character} zone name.}
}}

\item{rij_matrix}{\code{list} of \code{matrix} or \code{\linkS4class{dgCMatrix}}
objects specifying the amount of each feature (rows) within each planning
unit (columns) for each zone. The \code{list} elements denote
different zones, matrix rows denote features, and matrix columns denote
planning units. For convenience, the argument to
\code{rij_matrix} can be a single \code{matrix} or
\code{\linkS4class{dgCMatrix}} when specifying a problem with a
single management zone. This argument is only used when the argument
to \code{x} is a \code{numeric} or \code{matrix} object.}

\description{
Create a systematic conservation planning problem. This function is used to
specify the basic data used in a spatial prioritization problem: the
spatial distribution of the planning units and their costs, as well as
the features (e.g., species, ecosystems) that need to be conserved. After
constructing this object, it can be
customized to meet specific goals using \link{objectives},
\link{targets}, \link{constraints}, and
\link{penalties}. After building the problem, the
\code{\link[=solve]{solve()}} function can be used to identify solutions.

\details{
A systematic conservation planning exercise leverages data to help inform
conservation decision making. To help ensure that the
data -- and resulting prioritizations -- are relevant to the over-arching
goals of the exercise, you should decide on the management action
(or set of actions) that need be considered in the exercise.
For example, these actions could include establishing protected areas,
selecting land for conservation easements, restoring habitat,
planting trees for carbon sequestration, eradicating invasive
species, or some combination of the previous actions.
If the exercise involves multiple different actions, they can
be incorporated by using multiple zones
(see the Management Zones vignette for details). After deciding
on the management action(s), you can compile the following data.

First, you will need to create a set of planning units
(i.e., discrete spatial areas) to inform decision making.
Planning units are often created by subdividing a study region
into a set of square or hexagonal cells. They can also be created using
administrative boundaries (e.g., provinces), land management boundaries
(e.g., property boundaries derived from cadastral data), or
ecological boundaries (e.g., based on ecosystem classification data).
The size (i.e., spatial grain) of the planning units is often determined
based on a compromise between the scale needed to inform decision making, the
spatial accuracy (resolution) of available datasets, and
the computational resources available for generating prioritizations
(e.g., RAM and number of CPU cores on your computer).

Second, you will need data to quantify the cost of implementing
each management action within each planning unit.
Critically, the cost data should reflect the management action(s)
considered in the exercise.
For example, costs are often specified using data that reflect economic
expenditure (e.g., land acquisition cost),
socioeconomic conditions (e.g., human population density),
opportunity costs of foregone commercial activities
(e.g., logging or agriculture), or
opportunity costs of foregone recreational activities
(e.g., recreational fishing).
In some cases -- depending on the management action(s) considered --
it can make sense to use a constant cost value
(e.g., all planning units are assigned a cost value equal to one)
or use a cost value based on spatial extent
(e.g., each planning unit is assigned a cost value based on its total area).
Also, in most cases, you want to avoid negative cost values.
This is because a negative value means that a place is \emph{desirable}
for implementing a management action, and such places will almost
always be selected for prioritization even if they provide no benefit.

Third, you will need data to quantify the benefits of implementing
management actions within planning units.
To achieve this, you will need to select a set of conservation features
that relate to the over-arching goals of the exercise.
For example, conservation features often include
species (e.g., Clouded Leopard), habitats (e.g., mangroves or
cloud forest), or ecosystems.
The benefit that each feature derives from a planning unit
can take a variety of forms, but is typically occupancy (i.e.,
presence or absence), area of occurrence within each planning unit
(e.g., based on species' geographic range data), or
a measure of habitat suitability (e.g., estimated using a statistical model).
After compiling these data, you have the minimal data needed to generate
a prioritization.

A systematic conservation planning exercise involves prioritizing a set of
management actions to be implemented within certain planning units.
Critically, this prioritization should ideally optimize the trade-off
between benefits and costs.
To accomplish this, the \pkg{prioritizr} package uses input data
to formulate optimization problems (see Optimization section for details).
Broadly speaking, the goal of an optimization problem is to minimize
(or maximize) an objective function over a set of
decision variables, subject to a series of constraints.
Here, an objective function specifies the metric for evaluating
conservation plans. The decision variables are what we control, and usually
there is one binary variable for each planning unit to specify whether that
unit is selected or not (but other approaches are available, see
\link{decisions}). The constraints can be thought of as rules that must be
followed. For example, constraints can be used to ensure a prioritization
must stay within a certain budget. These constraints can also leverage
additional data to help ensure that prioritizations meet the over-arching
goals of the exercise. For example, to account for existing conservation
efforts, you could obtain data delineating the extent of existing protected
areas and use constraints to lock in planning units that are covered by them
(see \link{add_locked_in_constraints}).
}
\section{Optimization}{

The \pkg{prioritizr} package uses exact algorithms to solve reserve design
problems (see \link{solvers} for details).
To achieve this, it internally formulates mathematical optimization problems
using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The general form of
such problems can be expressed in matrix notation using
the following equation.

\deqn{\mathit{Minimize} \space \mathbf{c}^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{x} \space
\mathit{subject \space to} \space
\mathbf{Ax}\geq= or\leq \mathbf{b}}{Minimize (c^T)*x subject to Ax \ge, =,
or \le b}

Here, \eqn{x} is a vector of decision variables, \eqn{c} and \eqn{b} are
vectors of known coefficients, and \eqn{A} is the constraint
matrix. The final term specifies a series of structural
constraints where relational operators for the constraint can be either
\eqn{\ge}, \eqn{=}, or \eqn{\le} the coefficients. For example, in the
minimum set cover problem, \eqn{c} would be a vector of costs for each
planning unit, \eqn{b} a vector of targets for each conservation feature,
the relational operator would be \eqn{\ge} for all features, and \eqn{A}
would be the representation matrix with \eqn{A_{ij}=r_{ij}}{Aij = rij}, the
representation level of feature \eqn{i} in planning unit \eqn{j}.
If you wish to see exactly how a conservation planning problem is
formulated as mixed integer linear programming problem, you can use
the \code{\link[=write_problem]{write_problem()}} function to save the optimization problem
to a plain-text file on your computer and then view it using a standard
text editor (e.g., Notepad).

Please note that this function internally computes the amount of each
feature in each planning unit when this data is not supplied (using the
\code{\link[=rij_matrix]{rij_matrix()}} function). As a consequence, it can take a while to
initialize large-scale conservation planning problems that involve
millions of planning units.
