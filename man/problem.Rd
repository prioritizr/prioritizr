\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}},
\code{\link[sp]{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame-class}},
\code{\link[sp]{SpatialLinesDataFrame-class}}, or
\code{\link{data.frame}} object, or \code{\link{numeric}} vector,
specifying the planning units to use in the reserve design exercise and
their corresponding cost. It may be desirable to exclude some planning
units from the analysis, for example those outside the study area. To
exclude planning units, set the cost for those raster cells to \code{NA},
or use the \code{add_locked_out_constraint}.}

\item{features}{The correct argument for \code{features} depends on the
  input to \code{x}.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}},
      \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}}}{\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}}
      object showing the distribution of conservation features. Missing
      values (i.e. \code{NA} values) can be used to indicate the absence of
      a feature in a particular cell instead of explicitly setting these
      cells to zero.}

    \item{\code{\link{Spatial}}, \code{data.frame}}{\code{character} vector
      with column names that correspond to the abundance or occurrence of
      different features in each planning unit.}

    \item{\code{\link{Spatial}}, \code{data.frame} or
      \code{numeric}}{\code{data.frame} object
      containing information on the features. The argument to
      \code{feature_data} must follow the conventions used by Marxan. Each
      row corresponds to a different feature. It must also contain the
      following columns:
      \describe{
        \item{\code{"id"}}{\code{integer} unique identifier for each feature
          These identifiers are used in the argument to \code{rij}.}
        \item{\code{"name"}}{\code{character} name for each feature.}
        \item{\code{"prop"}}{\code{numeric} relative target for each feature
          (optional).}
        \item{\code{"amount"}}{\code{numeric} absolute target for each
          feature (optional).}
       }
    }
 }}

\item{cost_column}{\code{character} name or \code{integer} indicating the
column with the cost data. This argument must be supplied when the
argument to \code{x} is a \code{link{Spatial}} or \code{\link{data.frame}}
object.}

\item{rij}{\code{data.frame} containing information on the amount of
each feature in each planning unit. This argument is only used if
\code{x} is a \code{data.frame}. Similar to \code{features}, the
argument to \code{rij} must follow the conventions used by
Marxan. It must contain the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"pu"}}{\code{integer} planning unit identifier.}
  \item{\code{"species"}}{\code{integer} feature identifier.}
  \item{\code{"amount"}}{\code{numeric} amount of the feature in the
    planning unit.}
 }}

\item{rij_matrix}{\code{matrix} or \code{\link[Matrix]{dgCMatrix-class}}
object specifying the amount of each feature (rows) within each planning
unit (columns). Only used when \code{x} is a numeric vector of costs.}

\item{run_checks}{\code{logical} flag indicating whether checks should be
run to ensure the integrity of the input data. These checks are run by
default; however, for large data sets they may substantially increase run
time. If it is taking a prohibitively long time to create the
prioritization problem, it is suggested to try setting \code{run_checks}
to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{not used.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object containing the
  basic data used to build a prioritization problem.
}
\description{
Create a systematic conservation planning problem. This function is used to
specify the basic data used in a spatial prioritization problem: the
spatial distribution of the planning units and their costs, as well as
the features (e.g. species, ecosystems) that need to be conserved. After
constructing this \code{ConservationProblem-class} object, it can be
customized to meet specific goals using \code{\link{objectives}},
\code{\link{targets}}, \code{\link{constraints}}, and
\code{\link{penalties}}.
}
\details{
The basic prioritizr work flow starts with formulating the
\code{problem}, then adding \code{objectives} and \code{targets},
as well as \code{constraints} and \code{penalties} as needed.
Alternative decision formats can be specified using the
\code{\link{decisions}} functions,
otherwise the package will default to binary selection of planning units.
Lastly, the type of solving algorithm must be specified
(see \code{\link{solvers}}). Once formulated, the problem is solved
using the \code{solve()} function, which will return
a \code{RasterLayer-class},
\code{Spatial-class}, or a \code{numeric} vector
containing the solution depending on the \code{ConservationProblem-class}

A reserve design exercise starts by dividing the study region
into planning units (typically square or hexagonal cells) and, for
each planning unit, assigning values that quantify socioeconomic
cost and conservation benefit for a set of conservation features. The
cost can be the acquisition cost of the land, the cost of management,
the opportunity cost of foregone commercial activities (e.g. from logging
or agriculture), or simply the area. The conservation features are
typically species (e.g. Clouded Leopard) or habitats (e.g. mangroves or
cloud forest). The benefit that each feature derives from a planning unit
can take a variety of forms, but is typically either occupancy (i.e.
presence or absence) or area of occurrence within each planning unit.
Finally, in some types of reserve design models, for each conservation
feature, representation targets must be set, such as 20% of the current
extent of cloud forest or 10,000km^2 of Clouded Leopard habitat
(see \code{\link{targets}}).

The goal of the reserve design exercise is then to optimize the trade-off
between conservation benefit and socioeconomic cost, i.e. to get the most
benefit for your limited conservation funds. In general, the goal of an
optimization problem is to minimize an objective function over a set of
decision variables, subject to a series of constraints. The decision
variables
are what we control, usually there is one binary variable for each planning
unit specifying whether or not to protect that unit (but other approaches are
available, see \code{\link{decisions}}). The constraints can be thought
of as rules that need to be followed, for example, that the reserve must
stay within a certain budget or meet the representation targets.

Integer linear programming (ILP) is the subset of optimization algorithms
used in this package to solve reserve design problems. The general form of
an ILP problem can be expressed in matrix notation as:

\deqn{\mathit{Minimize} \space \mathbf{c}^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{x} \space
\mathit{subject \space to} \space
\mathbf{Ax}\geq= or\leq \mathbf{b}}{Minimize (c^T)*x subject to Ax \ge, =,
or \le b}

Where \emph{x} is a vector of decision variables, \emph{c} and \emph{b} are
vectors of known coefficients, and \emph{A} is the \strong{constraint
matrix}. The final term specifies a series of \strong{structural constraints}
where relational operators for the constraint can be either \eqn{\ge, =, or
\le} the coefficients. For example, in the minimum set cover problem,
\emph{c} would be a vector of costs for each planning unit, \emph{b} a
vector of targets for each conservation feature, the relational operator
would be \eqn{\ge} for all features, and \emph{A} would be the
representation matrix with \eqn{A_{ij}=r_{ij}}{Aij = rij}, the
representation level of feature \emph{i} in planning unit \emph{j}.
