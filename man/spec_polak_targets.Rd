\usage{
spec_polak_targets(
  rare_area_threshold = 1000,
  rare_relative_target = 1,
  common_area_threshold = 10000,
  common_relative_target = 0.1,
  cap_area_target = 1e+06,
  area_units = "km^2"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rare_area_threshold}{\code{numeric} value indicating the threshold area
for rare identifying rare features.
Defaults to 1000 (i.e., 1000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{rare_relative_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the
relative target for features with a spatial distribution
that is smaller than \code{rare_area_threshold}.
Note that this value must be a proportion between 0 and 1.
Defaults to 1 (i.e., 100\%).}

\item{common_area_threshold}{\code{numeric} value indicating the threshold
area for identifying common features.
Defaults to 10000
(i.e., 10,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{common_relative_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the
relative target for features with a spatial distribution
that is greater than \code{common_area_threshold}.
Defaults to 0.1 (i.e., 10\%).
Since this default value is based on historical levels of global protected
area coverage, it may be appropriate to set this value based on current
levels of protected area coverage (e.g., 17.6\% for terrestrial and 8.4\% for
marine systems globally; UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2025).}

\item{cap_area_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the area-based target cap.
To avoid setting a target cap, a missing (\code{NA}) value can be specified.
Defaults to 1000000
(i.e., 1,000,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{area_units}{\code{character} value denoting the unit of measurement
for the area-based arguments.
Defaults to \code{"km^2"}
(i.e., \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}
}
\value{
An object (\code{\linkS4class{Method}}) for specifying targets that
can be used with \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}
to update the targets for a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}
\description{
Specify targets based on the methodology outlined by
Polak \emph{et al.} (2015).
Briefly, this method involves setting targets based on linear
interpolation methods.
To help prevent widespread features from obscuring priorities,
targets are capped following Butchart \emph{et al.} (2015).
Note that this function is designed to be used with \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}.
}
\details{
This target setting method was designed to protect species in national-
scale prioritizations (Polak \emph{et al.} 2015).
Although it has been successfully applied to to national-scales
(e.g., Polak \emph{et al.} 2016; Clements \emph{et al.} 2018; ),
it may fail to identify meaningful priorities for
prioritizations conducted at smaller or larger geographic scales
(e.g., local or global scales).
For example, if this method is applied to
smaller geographic scales, then the resulting prioritizations
may select an overly large percentage of the study area,
or be biased towards over-representing common and widespread species.
This is because the thresholds for defining rare and common
features (i.e., \code{rare_area_threshold} and \code{common_area_threshold})
were originally developed based on criteria for national-scales.
As such, if you working at a different scale, you may need to calibrate
these thresholds based on the spatial extent of the planning region.
Please note that this function is provided as convenient method to
set targets for problems with a single management zone, and cannot
be used for those with multiple management zones.
}
\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method involves setting target thresholds based on the spatial
extent of the features.
By default, this method identifies rare features as those with a
spatial distribution smaller than 1,000
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}
(per \code{rare_area_threshold} and \code{area_units})
and common features as those with a spatial distribution
larger than 10,000
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}
(per \code{common_area_threshold} and \code{area_units}).
Given this, rare features are assigned a target threshold
of 100\% (per \code{rare_relative_target}), common features
are assigned a target threshold of 10\% (per \code{common_relative_target}),
and features with a spatial distribution that is between
the area-based thresholds used to identify rare and common features are
assigned a target threshold through linear interpolation.
Additionally, following Butchart \emph{et al.} (2015), a cap of 1,000,000
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} is applied to target
thresholds (per \code{cap_area_threshold} and \code{area_units}).
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
Although it can be readily applied to \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects that
have the feature data provided as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object,
you will need to specify the spatial units for the features
when initializing the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects if the feature data
are provided in a different format. In particular, if the feature
data are provided as a \code{data.frame} or \code{character} vector,
then you will need to specify an argument to \code{feature_units} when
using the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} function.
See the Examples section of the documentation for \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
for a demonstration of specifying the spatial units for features.
