add_max_utility_objective(x, budget)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} (i.e., \code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}}) object.}

\item{budget}{\code{numeric} value specifying the maximum expenditure of
the prioritization. For problems with multiple zones, the argument
to \code{budget} can be (i) a single \code{numeric} value to specify a single budget
for the entire solution or (ii) a \code{numeric} vector to specify
a separate budget for each management zone.}

\value{
Object (i.e., \code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}}) with the objective
added to it.
}
\description{
Set the objective of a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} to
secure as much of the features as possible without exceeding a budget.
This objective does not use targets, and feature
weights should be used instead to increase the representation of certain
features by a solution.
Note that this objective does not aim to maximize as much of each feature as
possible, and so often results in solutions that are heavily biased towards
just a few features.
}
\details{
The maximum utility objective seeks to maximize the overall level of
representation across a suite of conservation features, while keeping cost
within a fixed budget.
Additionally, weights can be used to favor the
representation of certain features over other features (see
\code{\link[=add_feature_weights]{add_feature_weights()}}).
}
\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This objective can be expressed mathematically for a set of planning units
(\eqn{I}{I} indexed by \eqn{i}{i}) and a set of features (\eqn{J}{J} indexed
by \eqn{j}{j}) as:

\deqn{\mathit{Maximize} \space \sum_{i = 1}^{I} -s \space c_i \space x_i +
\sum_{j = 1}^{J} a_j w_j \\
\mathit{subject \space to} \\ a_j = \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i r_{ij} \space
\forall j \in J \\ \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i c_i \leq B}{
Maximize sum_i^I (-s * ci * xi) + sum_j^J (aj * wj) subject to
aj = sum_i^I (xi * rij) for all j in J & sum_i^I (xi * ci) <= B}

Here, \eqn{x_i}{xi} is the \link{decisions} variable (e.g.,
specifying whether planning unit \eqn{i}{i} has been selected (1) or not
(0)), \eqn{r_{ij}}{rij} is the amount of feature \eqn{j}{j} in planning
unit \eqn{i}{i}, \eqn{A_j}{Aj} is the amount of feature \eqn{j}{j}
represented in in the solution, and \eqn{w_j}{wj} is the weight for
feature \eqn{j}{j} (defaults to 1 for all features; see
\code{\link[=add_feature_weights]{add_feature_weights()}}
to specify weights). Additionally, \eqn{B}{B} is the budget allocated for
the solution, \eqn{c_i}{ci} is the cost of planning unit \eqn{i}{i}, and
\eqn{s}{s} is a scaling factor used to shrink the costs so that the problem
will return a cheapest solution when there are multiple solutions that
represent the same amount of all features within the budget.

\section{Notes}{

In early versions (< 3.0.0.0), this function was named as
the \code{add_max_cover_objective} function. It was renamed to avoid
confusion with existing terminology.
