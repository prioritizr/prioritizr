\description{
Specify targets based on criteria from the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of
Ecosystems (IUCN 2024).
This function is designed to be used within \code{add_auto_targets()} and
\code{add_group_targets()}.
}
\details{
Targets based on criteria from the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems
may be appropriate for global and national scale prioritizations.
Despite this, prioritizations based on these criteria may fail to identify
meaningful priorities for prioritizations conducted at smaller geographic
scales (e.g, local or county scales).
For example, if this method is applied to
smaller geographic scales, then the resulting prioritizations
may select an overly large percentage of the study area,
or be biased towards over-representing common and widespread species.
This is because the target thresholds were developed based on
criteria for promoting the long-term persistence of entire species.
As such, if you are working at smaller scales, it is recommended to set
thresholds based on that criteria are appropriate to the spatial extent
of the planning region.
Please note that this function is provided as convenient method to
set targets for problems with a single management zone, and cannot
be used for those with multiple management zones.
}
\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method involves setting target thresholds based on assessment
criteria from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
Red List of Ecosystems (IUCN 2024).
To express this mathematically, we will define the following terminology.
Let \eqn{f} denote the total abundance of a feature (e.g., geographic
range size), \eqn{a} the threshold value from Criterion A based on the
specified threat status (per \code{status}, see below for details),
\eqn{b} the threshold value from Criterion B
based on the specified threat status (per \code{status}, see below for details),
\eqn{p} the percentage uplift as a proportion (per \code{prop_uplift}),
and \eqn{c} the target cap (per \code{cap_threshold}).
Additionally, let
\eqn{\box()}{box()} denote either \eqn{max()} or \eqn{min()} (per \code{method}).
Given this terminology, the target threshold (\eqn{t}) for a feature
is calculated as follows.
\deqn{
t = min(min(\box(b, f \times ((1 + p) \times (1 - a))), c), f)
}{
t = min(min(box(b, f * ((1 + p) * (1 - a))) , c), f)
}

Additionally, \eqn{a} is equal to one of the following values depending on
\code{status} and \code{criterion_a}.
Note that if \code{criterion_a} has a value of \code{"A2a"} or \verb{"A2b", then \eqn{a} is assigned the same value as if had a value of }"A1"`.
\itemize{
\item If \code{status = "CR"} and \code{criterion_a = "A1"}, then \eqn{a =} 80\%.
\item If \code{status = "EN"} and \code{criterion_a = "A1"}, then \eqn{a =} 50\%.
\item If \code{status = "VU"} and \code{criterion_a = "A1"}, then \eqn{a =} 30\%.
\item If \code{status = "CR"} and \code{criterion_a = "A3"}, then \eqn{a =} 90\%.
\item If \code{status = "EN"} and \code{criterion_a = "A3"}, then \eqn{a =} 70\%.
\item If \code{status = "VU"} and \code{criterion_a = "A3"}, then \eqn{a =} 30\%.
}

Additionally, \eqn{b} is equal to one of the following values
depending on \code{status} and \code{criterion_b}.
\itemize{
\item If \code{status = "CR"} and \code{criterion_a = "B1"}, then \eqn{b =} 2,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
\item If \code{status = "EN"} and \code{criterion_a = "B1"}, then \eqn{b =} 20,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
\item If \code{status = "VU"} and \code{criterion_a = "B1"}, then \eqn{b =} 50,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
\item If \code{status = "CR"} and \code{criterion_a = "B2"}, then \eqn{b =} 200 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
\item If \code{status = "EN"} and \code{criterion_a = "B2"}, then \eqn{b =} 2,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
\item If \code{status = "VU"} and \code{criterion_a = "B2"}, then \eqn{b =} 5,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
}

\section{Target setting}{

Many conservation planning problems require targets.
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount, or proportion, of a
feature's spatial distribution that should ideally be protected.
This is important so that the optimization process can weigh the merits
and trade-offs between improving the representation of one feature over
another feature.
Although it can be challenging to set meaningful targets,
this is a critical step for ensuring that prioritizations
meet the stakeholder objectives that underpin a prioritization exercise
(Carwardine \emph{et al.} 2009).
In other words, targets play an important role in ensuring that a
priority setting process is properly tuned according to stakeholder
requirements.
For example, targets provide a mechanism for ensuring that a
prioritization secures enough habitat to promote the long-term persistence
of each threatened species, culturally important species,
or economically important ecosystem service under consideration.
Since there is often uncertainty regarding stakeholder objectives
(e.g., how much habitat should be protected for a given species)
or the influence of particular target on a prioritization
(e.g., how would setting a 90\% or 100\% for a threatened species alter
priorities), it is often useful to generate and compare a suite of
prioritizations based on different target scenarios.

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
As such, this function may need to make particular assumptions depending
on the data used to specify the planning units and features in \code{x}.
If possible, when building \code{x} with \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}, it is recommended to specify
\code{features} as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object to ensure correctness.
Although this function can be used to specify targets for features
in other data formats, you must take care to ensure that the information
specifying the amount of each feature are in units of 1 km
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
To help ensure that you are aware of this limitation, this function will
produce a warning to alert you when the features in \code{x} belong to such
data formats.
If you are confident that your data are in the correct units,
then you can safely ignore this warning.
Below we provide details for ensuring that the targets are calculated
correctly.

\describe{
\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} planning units and \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} features}{
This function will automatically ensure that the targets are calculated
correctly. Given this, it is recommended to specify \code{features} in either
of these when building a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{character} features}{
Here, the argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify
which columns of the planning unit data denote the amount of each feature
present within each planning unit.
All of these columns must contain values in
units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
For example, if \code{features = c("spp1", "spp2", "spp3")}, then the columns
\code{"spp1"}, \code{"spp2"}, and \code{"spp3"} of the planning unit denote data the amount
of the first, second, and third features (respectively) present within each
planning unit. If the column \code{"spp1"} has a value of 5 in the first row
of the planning unit data, then this means the first planning unit
contains 5 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}
of habitat for the feature \code{"spp1"}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij} must contain a \code{data.frame}
with the columns \code{"pu"}, \code{"species"}, \code{"amount"}. For a given row,
the \code{"pu"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the identifier
for the planning unit,
the \code{"species"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the
identifier for the feature,
and \verb{"amount" contains a }numeric\verb{value denoting the amount of the the feature (per the}"species"\verb{column) that is present in the planning unit (per}"pu"\verb{column). Given this, the "amount" column must contain values that in units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}. For example, if the argument to}rij\verb{has a row where the}"pu"\verb{column has a value of 1, the}"species"\verb{column has a value of 2, and the}"amount"` column has a value of 3: then this means that the
planning unit with an identifier of 1 contains 3
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of the feature
associated with the identifier of 2.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{numeric} or \code{matrix} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij_matrix} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij_matrix} must contain a \code{matrix}
(or \code{list} of \code{matrix} objects) that contains \code{numeric} values in units of 1
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
