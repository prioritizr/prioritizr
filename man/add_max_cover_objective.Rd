\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} (i.e., \code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}}) object.}

\item{budget}{\code{numeric} value specifying the maximum expenditure of
the prioritization. For problems with multiple zones, the argument
to \code{budget} can be a single \code{numeric} value to specify a budget
for the entire solution or a \code{numeric} vector to specify
a budget for each each management zone.}

Object (i.e., \code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}}) with the objective
added to it.

\description{
Set the objective of a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} to
represent at least one instance of as many features as possible within a
given budget. This objective does not use targets, and feature
weights should be used instead to increase the representation of certain
features by a solution.
}
\details{
The maximum coverage objective seeks to find the set of planning units that
maximizes the number of represented features, while keeping cost within a
fixed budget. Here, features are treated as being represented if
the reserve system contains at least a single instance of a feature
(i.e., an amount greater than 1). This formulation has often been
used in conservation planning problems dealing with binary biodiversity
data that indicate the presence/absence of suitable habitat
(e.g., Church & Velle 1974). Additionally, weights can be used to favor the
representation of certain features over other features (see
\code{\link[=add_feature_weights]{add_feature_weights()}}). Check out the
\code{\link[=add_max_features_objective]{add_max_features_objective()}} for a more
generalized formulation which can accommodate user-specified representation
targets.
}
\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This objective is based on the maximum coverage reserve
selection problem (Church & Velle 1974; Church \emph{et al.} 1996).
The maximum coverage objective for the reserve design problem can be
expressed mathematically for a set of planning units (\eqn{I}{I} indexed by
\eqn{i}{i}) and a set of features (\eqn{J}{J} indexed by \eqn{j}{j}) as:

\deqn{\mathit{Maximize} \space \sum_{i = 1}^{I} -s \space c_i \space x_i +
\sum_{j = 1}^{J} y_j w_j \\
\mathit{subject \space to} \\
\sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i r_{ij} \geq y_j \times 1 \forall j \in J \\
\sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i c_i \leq B}{
Maximize sum_i^I (-s * ci * xi) + sum_j^J (yj * wj) subject to
sum_i^I (xi * rij) >= (yj * 1) for all j in J &
sum_i^I (xi * ci) <= B}

Here, \eqn{x_i}{xi} is the \link{decisions} variable (e.g.,
specifying whether planning unit \eqn{i}{i} has been selected (1) or not
(0)), \eqn{r_{ij}}{rij} is the amount of feature \eqn{j}{j} in planning
unit \eqn{i}{i}, \eqn{y_j}{yj} indicates if the solution has meet
the target \eqn{t_j}{tj} for feature \eqn{j}{j}, and \eqn{w_j}{wj} is the
weight for feature \eqn{j}{j} (defaults to 1 for all features; see
\code{\link[=add_feature_weights]{add_feature_weights()}} to specify weights). Additionally,
\eqn{B}{B} is the budget allocated for the solution, \eqn{c_i}{ci} is the
cost of planning unit \eqn{i}{i}, and \eqn{s}{s} is a scaling factor used
to shrink the costs so that the problem will return a cheapest solution
when there are multiple solutions that represent the same amount of all
features within the budget.

\section{Notes}{

In early versions (< 3.0.0.0), the mathematical formulation
underpinning this function was very different. Specifically,
as described above, the function now follows the formulations outlined in
Church \emph{et al.} (1996). The old formulation is now provided by the
\code{\link[=add_max_utility_objective]{add_max_utility_objective()}} function.
