\title{Add Maximum Coverage Objective}
\usage{
add_max_cover_objective(x, budget)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.}

\item{budget}{\code{numeric} value specifying the maximum expenditure of
the prioritization.}
}
\description{
Set an objective to find the solution that secures as much of each feature
as possible without exceeding the budget. This type of objective does not
require the addition of targets.
}
\details{
A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
conservation planning problem. Please note that \strong{all conservation
planning problems formulated in the prioritizr package require the addition
of objectives}. Failing to do so will return a default error message
when solving.

The maximum coverage problem seeks to find the set of planning units that
maximizes the overall level of representation across a suite of conservation
features, while keeping cost within a fixed budget. This problem is roughly
the opposite of what the conservation planning software Marxan does.

The maximum coverage objective for the reserve design problem can be
expressed mathematically for a set of planning units (\eqn{I}{I} indexed by
\eqn{i}{i}) and a set of features (\eqn{J}{J} indexed by \eqn{j}{j}) as:

\deqn{\mathit{Maximize} \space \sum_{i = 1}^{I} s \space c_i +
\sum_{j = 1}^{J} a_j w_j \\
\mathit{subject \space to} \\ a_j = \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i r_{ij} \space
\forall j \in J \\ \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i c_i \leq B}{
Maximize sum_i^I (s * ci) + sum_j^J (aj * wj) subject to
aj = sum_i^I (xi * rij) for all j in J & sum_i^I (xi * ci) <= B}

Here, \eqn{x_i}{xi} is the \code{\link{decisions}} variable (e.g.
specifying whether planning unit \eqn{i}{i} has been selected (1) or not
(0)), \eqn{r_{ij}}{rij} is the amount of feature \eqn{j}{j} in planning unit
\eqn{i}{i}, \eqn{A_j}{Aj} is the amount of feature \eqn{j}{j} represented in
in the solution, and \eqn{w_j}{wj} is the weight for feature \eqn{j}{j}
(defaults to 1 for all features; see \code{\link{add_feature_weights}}
to specify weights). Additionally, \eqn{B}{B} is the budget allocated for
the solution, \eqn{c_i}{ci} is the cost of planning unit \eqn{i}{i}, and
\eqn{s}{s} is a scaling factor used to shrink the costs so that the problem
will return a cheapest solution when there are multiple solutions that
represent the same amount of all features within the budget.
