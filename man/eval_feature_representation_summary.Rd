\usage{
eval_feature_representation_summary(x, solution)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object.}

\item{solution}{\code{numeric}, \code{matrix}, \code{data.frame},
\code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}}, or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} object.
The argument should be in the same format as the planning unit cost
data in the argument to \code{x}.
See the Solution format section for more information.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} object describing feature representation.
Here, each row describes a specific summary statistic
(e.g., different management zone) for a specific feature.
It contains the following columns:

\describe{

\item{summary}{\code{character} description of the summary statistic.
The statistics associated with the \code{"overall"} value
in this column are calculated using all planning unit values.
For problems with multiple management zones, this means
that all calculations are completed by summing together
all planning unit values across all zones. For example, if there are
two zones, a single planning unit, and a feature has a value of one
in the single planning unit for both zones, then \code{total_amount} will
contain a value of two (even though it would not be possible to
to achieve a value of two because the planning unit could not
simultaneously be allocated to both zones).
Additionally, if multiple management zones are present,
then summary statistics are also provided for each zone separately
(indicated using zone names).}

\item{feature}{\code{character} name of the feature.}

\item{total_amount}{\code{numeric} total amount of each feature available
in the entire conservation planning problem
(not just planning units selected within the solution).
It is calculated as the sum of the feature data,
supplied when creating a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object
(e.g., presence/absence values).}

\item{absolute_held}{\code{numeric} total amount of each feature secured within
the solution. It is calculated as the sum of the feature data,
supplied when creating a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object
(e.g., presence/absence values), weighted by the status of each
planning unit in the solution (e.g., selected or not for
prioritization).}

\item{relative_held}{\code{numeric} proportion of
each feature secured within the solution. It is calculated
by dividing values in the \code{"absolute_held"} column by those in the
\code{"total_amount"} column.}

}
}
\description{
Calculate how well features are represented by a solution
to a conservation planning problem.
These summary statistics are reported for each and every feature,
and each and every zone, within a conservation planning problem.
}
\section{Solution format}{

Broadly speaking, the argument to \code{solution} must be in the same format as
the planning unit data in the argument to \code{x}.
Further details on the correct format are listed separately
for each of the different planning unit data formats:

\describe{

\item{\code{x} has \code{numeric} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution} must be a
\code{numeric} vector with each element corresponding to a different planning
unit. It should have the same number of planning units as those
in the argument to \code{x}. Additionally, any planning units missing
cost (\code{NA}) values should also have missing (\code{NA}) values in the
argument to \code{solution}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{matrix} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution} must be a
\code{matrix} vector with each row corresponding to a different planning
unit, and each column correspond to a different management zone.
It should have the same number of planning units and zones
as those in the argument to \code{x}. Additionally, any planning units
missing cost (\code{NA}) values for a particular zone should also have a
missing (\code{NA}) values in the argument to \code{solution}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution}
be a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object where different cells correspond
to different planning units and layers correspond to
a different management zones. It should have the same dimensionality
(rows, columns, layers), resolution, extent, and coordinate reference
system as the planning units in the argument to \code{x}. Additionally,
any planning units missing cost (\code{NA}) values for a particular zone
should also have missing (\code{NA})  values in the argument to \code{solution}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{data.frame} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution} must
be a \code{data.frame} with each column corresponding to a different zone,
each row corresponding to a different planning unit, and cell values
corresponding to the solution value. This means that if a \code{data.frame}
object containing the solution also contains additional columns, then
these columns will need to be subsetted prior to using this function
(see below for example with \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} data).
Additionally, any planning units missing cost
(\code{NA}) values for a particular zone should also have missing (\code{NA})
values in the argument to \code{solution}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution} must be
a \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} object with each column corresponding to a different
zone, each row corresponding to a different planning unit, and cell values
corresponding to the solution value. This means that if the
\code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} object containing the solution also contains additional
columns, then these columns will need to be subsetted prior to using this
function (see below for example).
Additionally, the argument to \code{solution} must also have the same
coordinate reference system as the planning unit data.
Furthermore, any planning units missing cost
(\code{NA}) values for a particular zone should also have missing (\code{NA})
values in the argument to \code{solution}.
