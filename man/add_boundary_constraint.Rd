\title{Add boundary constraints}
\usage{
add_boundary_constraint(x, penalty, edge_factor)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem}} object.}

\item{penalty}{\code{numeric} penalty for exposed edges. This
is equivalent to the
\href{http://marxan.net/downloads/uq_marxan_web_2/module2.html}{boundary 
length modifier (BLM)} parameter in \href{marxan.net}{Marxan}.}

\item{edge_factor}{\code{numeric} proportion to scale edges that do
not have any neighboring planning units. For example, an edge factor
of \code{0.5} is commonly used for planning units along the coast line.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ConservationProblem}} object.
}
\description{
Add constraints to a conservation problem that favor solutions that clump
selected planning units together into contiguous reserves.
}
\examples{
# create basic problem
p <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
  add_minimum_set_objective() \%>\%
  add_relative_targets(0.2)

# create problem with added boundary constraints such that outer edges
# receive the same penalty as inner edges
p2 <- p \%>\% add_boundary_constraint(5, 1)

# create problem with added boundary constraints such that outer edges
# receive half the penalty as inner edges
p3 <- p \%>\% add_boundary_constraint(5, 0.5)

# solve problems
s <- stack(solve(p), solve(p2), solve(p3))
names(s) <- c('basic solution', 
  'solution with boundary constraints (edge_factor=1)',
  'solution with boundary constraints (edge_factor=0.5)')

# plot solutions
plot(s)
