\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.}

\item{penalty}{\code{numeric} penalty value that is used to scale the
importance not selecting planning units with high \code{data} values.
Higher \code{penalty} values can be used to obtain solutions that
are strongly averse to selecting places with high \code{data}
values, and smaller \code{penalty} values can be used to obtain solutions
that only avoid places with especially high \code{data} values.
Note that negative
\code{penalty} values can be used to obtain solutions that prefer places
with high \code{data} values. Additionally, when adding these
penalties to problems with multiple zones, the argument to \code{penalty}
must have a value for each zone.}

\item{data}{\code{character}, \code{numeric},
\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}}, \code{matrix}, or \code{Matrix} object
containing the data used to penalize solutions. Planning units that are
associated with higher data values are penalized more strongly
in the solution. See the Details section for more information.}
}
\description{
Add penalties to a conservation planning \code{\link{problem}} to penalize
solutions that select planning units with higher values from a specific
data source (e.g. anthropogenic impact). These penalties assume
a linear trade-off between the penalty values and the primary
objective of the conservation planning \code{\link{problem}} (e.g.
solution cost for minimum set problems; \code{\link{add_min_set_objective}}.
}
\details{
This function penalizes solutions that have higher values according
  to a specific metric. The argument to \code{data} can be specified in
  several different ways:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{character}}{field (column) name(s) that contain the data for
    penalizing planning units. This type of argument is only
    compatible if the planning units in the argument to \code{x} are a
    \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}}, \code{\link[sf]{sf}}, or
    \code{data.frame} object. The fields (columns) must have \code{numeric}
    values, and must not contain any missing (\code{NA}) values.
    For problems involving multiple zones, the argument to \code{data} must
    contain a field name for each zone.}

  \item{\code{numeric}}{\code{vector} containing the data for penalizing
    each planning unit. These values must not contain any missing
    (\code{NA}) values. Note that this type of argument is only available
    for planning units that contain a single zone.}

  \item{\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}}}{containing the data for
    penalizing planning units. This type of argument is only
    compatible if the planning units in the argument to \code{x} are
    \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}}, \code{\link[sf]{sf}}, or
    or \code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} (i.e. they are in a spatially
    referenced format).
    If the planning unit data are a \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}} or
    \code{\link[sf]{sf}} object, then the
    penalty \code{data} are calculated by overlaying the planning units with
    the argument to \code{data} and calculating the sum of the values.
    If the planning unit data are in the
    \code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} then the penalty \code{data} are
    calculated by extracting the cell values (note that the
    planning unit data and the argument to code{data} must have exactly
    the same dimensionality, extent, and missingness).
    For problems involving multiple zones, the argument to \code{data} must
    contain a layer for each zone.}

  \item{\code{matrix}, \code{Matrix}}{containing \code{numeric} values
    that specify data for penalizing each planning unit.
    Each row corresponds to a planning unit, each column corresponds to a
    zone, and each cell indicates the data for penalizing a planning unit
    when it is allocated to a given zone.}

  }

 The linear penalties are calculated using the following equations.
 Let \eqn{I} denote the set of planning units
 (indexed by \eqn{i}), \eqn{Z} the set of management zones (indexed by
 \eqn{z}), and \eqn{X_{iz}}{Xiz} the decision variable for allocating
 planning unit \eqn{i} to zone \eqn{z} (e.g. with binary
 values one indicating if planning unit is allocated or not). Also, let
 \eqn{P_z} represent the penalty scaling value for zones
 \eqn{z \in Z}{z in Z} (argument to \code{penalty}), and
 \eqn{D_{iz}}{Diz} the penalty data for allocating planning unit
 \eqn{i \in I}{i in I} to zones \eqn{z \in Z}{z in Z} (argument to
 \code{data} if supplied as a \code{matrix} object).

 \deqn{
 \sum_{i}^{I} \sum_{z}^{Z} P_z \times D_{iz} \times X_{iz}
 }{
 sum_i^I sum_z^Z (Pz * Diz * Xiz)
 }

 Note that when the problem objective is to maximize some measure of
 benefit and not minimize some measure of cost, the term \eqn{P_z} is
 replaced with \eqn{-P_z}.
