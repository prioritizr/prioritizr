\usage{
add_default_decisions(x)

add_binary_decisions(x)

add_proportion_decisions(x)

add_semicontinuous_decisions(x, upper_limit)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.}

\item{upper_limit}{\code{numeric} value specifying the maximum proportion
of a planning unit that can be reserved (eg. set to 0.8 for 80 \%).}
}
\value{
\code{\link{Decision-class}} object.
}
\description{
Conservation planning problems involve making decisions on planning units.
These decisions are then associated with actions (eg. turning a planning
unit into a protected area). Below is a list of decisions that can be
added to a conservation planning problem.
}
\details{
Only a single decision should be added to a
\code{ConservationProblem} object. \strong{If multiple decisions are added
to a problem object, then the last one to be added will be used.}

\describe{

  \item{\code{add_default_decisions}}{This decision represents the default
    decision if no decision is specified when constructing a conservation
    planning problem. It defaults to using a \code{binary_decision}.}

  \item{\code{add_binary_decisions}}{This is the classic decision of either
    prioritizing or not prioritizing a planning unit. Typically,
    this decision has the assumed action of buying the planning
    unit to include in a protected area network.}

  \item{\code{add_proportion_decisions}}{This is a relaxed decision where
    a part of a planning unit can be prioritized. Typically, this
    this decision has the assumed action of buying a fraction of
    a planning unit to include in a protected area network.}

  \item{\code{add_semicontinuous_decisions}}{This decision is similar to the
    \code{proportion_decision} except that it has an upper bound
    parameter. By default, the decision can range from prioritizing
    none (0 \%) to all (100 \%) of a planning unit. However, a upper
    bound can be specified to ensure that at most only a fraction
    (eg. 80 \%) of a planning unit can be preserved. This type of
    decision may be useful when it is not practical to conserve the
    entire planning unit.}

\examples{
# create basic problem and using the default decision (binary)
p <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
       add_min_set_objective() \%>\%
       add_relative_targets(0.1)

# manually specify a binary decision type
p2 <- p \%>\% add_binary_decisions()

# specify a proportion decision type
p3 <- p \%>\% add_proportion_decisions()

# specify a semicontinuous decision type
p4 <- p \%>\% add_semicontinuous_decisions(upper_limit=0.5)

\donttest{
# solve problem
s <- stack(solve(p), solve(p2), solve(p3), solve(p4))

# plot solutions
plot(s, main = c("default (binary)", "binary", "proportion",
                 "semicontinuous (upper=0.5)"))
