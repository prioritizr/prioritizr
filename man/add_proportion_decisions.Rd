add_proportion_decisions(x)

\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} (i.e., \code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}}) object.}

\value{
Object (i.e., \code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}}) with the decisions added
to it.
}
\description{
Add a proportion decision to a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
This is a relaxed decision where a part of a planning unit can be
prioritized as opposed to the entire planning unit. Typically, this decision
has the assumed action of buying a fraction of a planning unit to include in
decisions will solve much faster than problems that use binary-type
decisions
}
\details{
Conservation planning problems involve making decisions on planning
units. These decisions are then associated with actions (e.g., turning a
planning unit into a protected area). Only a
single decision should be added to a \code{ConservationProblem} object.
Note that if multiple decisions are added to a problem object, then the
last one to be added will be used.
