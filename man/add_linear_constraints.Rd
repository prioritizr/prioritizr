\description{
Add constraints to a conservation planning problem to ensure
that all selected planning units meet certain criteria.
}
\details{
This function adds general purpose constraints that can be used to
ensure that solutions meet certain criteria
(see Examples section below for details).
For example, these constraints can be used to add multiple budgets.
They can also be used to ensure that the total number of planning units
allocated to a certain administrative area (e.g., country) does not exceed
a certain threshold (e.g., 30\% of its total area). Furthermore,
they can also be used to ensure that features have a minimal level
of representation (e.g., 30\%) when using an objective
function that aims to enhance feature representation given a budget
(e.g., \code{\link[=add_min_shortfall_objective]{add_min_shortfall_objective()}}).
}
\section{Mathematical formulation}{

The linear constraints are implemented using the following
equation.
Let \eqn{I} denote the set of planning units
(indexed by \eqn{i}), \eqn{Z} the set of management zones (indexed by
\eqn{z}), and \eqn{X_{iz}}{Xiz} the decision variable for allocating
planning unit \eqn{i} to zone \eqn{z} (e.g., with binary
values indicating if each planning unit is allocated or not). Also, let
\eqn{D_{iz}}{Diz} denote the constraint data associated with
planning units \eqn{i \in I}{i in I} for zones \eqn{z \in Z}{z in Z}
(argument to \code{data}, if supplied as a \code{matrix} object),
\eqn{\theta} denote the constraint sense
(argument to \code{sense}, e.g., \eqn{<=}), and \eqn{t} denote the constraint
threshold (argument to \code{threshold}).

\deqn{
\sum_{i}^{I} \sum_{z}^{Z} (D_{iz} \times X_{iz}) \space \theta \space t
}{
sum_i^I sum (Diz * Xiz) \theta t
}
}

\section{Data format}{


The argument to \code{data} can be specified using the following formats.

\describe{

\item{\code{data} as \code{character} vector}{containing column name(s) that
contain penalty values for planning units. This format is only
compatible if the planning units in the argument to \code{x} are a
\code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} or \code{data.frame} object. The column(s) must have \code{numeric}
values, and must not contain any missing (\code{NA}) values.
For problems that contain a single zone, the argument to \code{data} must
contain a single column name. Otherwise, for problems that
contain multiple zones, the argument to \code{data} must
contain a column name for each zone.}

\item{\code{data} as a \code{numeric} vector}{containing values for
planning units. These values must not contain any missing
(\code{NA}) values. Note that this format is only available
for planning units that contain a single zone.}

\item{\code{data} as a \code{matrix}/\code{Matrix} object}{containing \code{numeric} values
that specify data for each planning unit.
Each row corresponds to a planning unit, each column corresponds to a
zone, and each cell indicates the data for penalizing a planning unit
when it is allocated to a given zone.}

\item{\code{data} as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object}{containing values for planning
units. This format is only
compatible if the planning units in the argument to \code{x} are
\code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}}, or \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} objects.
If the planning unit data are a \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} object,
then the values are calculated by overlaying the
planning units with the argument to \code{data} and calculating the sum of the
values associated with each planning unit.
If the planning unit data are a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object, then the values
are calculated by extracting the cell
values (note that the planning unit data and the argument to \code{data} must
have exactly the same dimensionality, extent, and missingness).
For problems involving multiple zones, the argument to \code{data} must
contain a layer for each zone.}
