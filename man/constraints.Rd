\title{Conservation problem constraints}
\description{
A constraint can be added to a conservation planning \code{\link{problem}}
to ensure that solutions exhibit a specific characteristic.
}
\details{
Constraints can be used to ensure that solutions exhibit
  a range of different characteristics. For instance, they can be
  used to lock in or lock out certain planning units from the solution, such
  as protected areas or degraded land (respectively).
  Additionally, similar to the \code{\link{penalties}} functions,
  some of the constraint functions can be used to increase connectivity in a
  solution. The key difference between a penalty and a constraint, however,
  is that constraints work by invalidating solutions that do not exhibit
  a specific characteristic, whereas penalty functions work by than
  penalizing solutions which do not meet a specific characteristic. Thus
  constraints do not affect the objective function. The following constraints
  are available.

  The following constraints can be added to a conservation planning
  \code{\link{problem}}:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{\link{add_locked_in_constraints}}}{Add constraints to ensure
    that certain planning units are selected in the solution.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_locked_out_constraints}}}{Add constraints to ensure
    that certain planning units are not selected in the solution.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_neighbor_constraints}}}{Add constraints to
    ensure that all selected planning units have at least a certain number
    of neighbors.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_contiguity_constraints}}}{Add constraints to a
    ensure that all selected planning units are spatially connected to each
    other and form a single contiguous unit.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_feature_contiguity_constraints}}}{Add constraints to #'     ensure that each feature is represented in a contiguous unit of
    dispersible habitat. These constraints are a more advanced version of
    those implemented in the \code{\link{add_contiguity_constraints}}
    function, because they ensure that each feature is represented in a
    contiguous unit and not that the entire solution should form a
    contiguous unit.}
