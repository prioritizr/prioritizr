\item{\code{\link{add_connected_constraints}}}{
Add constraints to a conservation problem to ensure that all selected
planning units are spatially connected to each other.
  }

\item{\code{\link{add_corridor_constraints}}}{
It is important to maintain connectivity between reserves. However,
some areas are more difficult for species to traverse then other areas.
As a consequence, even though reserves may be connected, species may
not be able to move between reserves if the areas connecting them
are barriers to dispersal.

This function adds constraints to ensure that corridors connect
reserves and that individuals from all species can utilize the
corridors. Friction \code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} objects area
used to show each difficult areas are to traverse.
}

\item{\code{\link{add_locked_in_constraints}}}{
Add constraints to ensure that they are prioritized in the solution.
For example, it may be desirable to lock in planning units that are
inside existing protected areas so that the solution fills in the gaps in the
existing reserve network.
}

\item{\code{\link{add_locked_out_constraints}}}{
Add constraints to ensure that certain planning units are not prioritized
in the solution. For example, it may be useful to lock out planning
units that have been degraded and are not longer suitable for conserving
species.
}

\item{\code{\link{add_neighbor_constraints}}}{
Add constraints to a conservation problem to ensure that all selected
planning units have at least a certain number of neighbors.
}
