\description{
Specify targets by interpolating them between area-based thresholds.
Briefly, this method involves
(i) setting target thresholds for rare features to a particular percentage
threshold, (ii) setting target thresholds for common features
to a particular percentage threshold, and (iii) interpolating
target thresholds for features with spatial distributions that
range between the those for the rare and common features.
Additionally, features can (optionally) have their targets capped at a
particular threshold.
This method is especially useful for setting targets based on
interpolation procedures when features have data in an area-based
unit of measurement (e.g., \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).
Note that this function is designed to be used within \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}.
}
\details{
This method has been applied to set target thresholds at global and national
scales (e.g., Butchart \emph{et al.} 2015;
Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2004; Polak *et al.*2015).
It is based on the rationale that species with a smaller geographic
distribution are at a greater risk of extinction, and so require
a larger percentage of their geographic distribution to be represented
by a prioritization (Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2004).
When using this method in a planning exercise, it is important to ensure
that the threshold parameters reflect the stakeholder objectives.
Additionally, the threshold parameters may need to calibrated based on
the spatial extent of the planning region.
}
\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method provides a flexible approach for setting target thresholds based
on an interpolation procedure and the spatial extent of the features.
To express this mathematically, we will define the following terminology.
Let \eqn{f} denote the total spatial extent of a feature (e.g., geographic
range size),
\eqn{a} the threshold for identifying rare features
(per \code{rare_area_threshold}),
\eqn{b} the relative targets for rare features
(per \code{rare_relative_target}),
\eqn{c} the area-based targets for rare features
(per \code{rare_area_target}),
\eqn{d()} the function for calculating targets for rare features
as a maximum or minimum value (per \code{rare_method}).
\eqn{e} the threshold for identifying common features
(per \code{common_area_threshold}),
\eqn{g} the relative targets for common features
(per \code{common_relative_target}),
\eqn{h} the area-based targets for common features
(per \code{common_area_target}),
\eqn{i()} the method for calculating targets for common features
as a maximum or minimum value  (per \code{common_method}).
\eqn{j} the target cap (per \code{cap_area_target}).
\eqn{k()} the interpolation method for features with a spatial distribution
that is larger than a rare features and smaller than a common feature
(per \code{interp_method}).
In particular, \eqn{j()} is either a linear or log-linear interpolation
procedure based on the thresholds for identifying rare and common features
as well as the relative targets for rare and common features.
Given this terminology, the target threshold (\eqn{t}) for a feature
is calculated as follows.
\itemize{
\item If \eqn{f < a}, then \eqn{t = min(d(c, b * f), j)}.
\item If \eqn{f > e}, then \eqn{t = min(i(h, g * f), j)}.
\item If \eqn{a <= f <= e}, then \eqn{t = min(k(f, a, b, e, g), j)}.
}
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
Although it can be readily applied to \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects that
have the feature data provided as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object,
you will need to specify the spatial units for the features
when initializing the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects if the feature data
are provided in a different format. In particular, if the feature
data are provided as a \code{data.frame} or \code{character} object,
then you will need to specify an argument to \code{feature_units} when
using the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} function. See the Examples section below for a
demonstration of using the \code{feature_units} parameter.
