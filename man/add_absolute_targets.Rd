\description{
Set targets expressed as the actual value of features in the study area
that need to be represented in the prioritization. For instance,
setting a target of 10 requires that the solution secure a set of
planning units for which their summed feature values are equal to or greater
than 10.
}
\details{
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a
feature's distribution that needs to be protected. Most conservation
planning problems require targets with the exception of the maximum cover
(see \code{\link[=add_max_cover_objective]{add_max_cover_objective()}}) and maximum utility
(see \code{\link[=add_max_utility_objective]{add_max_utility_objective()}}) problems. Attempting to solve
problems with objectives that require targets without specifying targets
will throw an error.

The targets for a problem can be specified in several different ways:

\describe{

\item{\code{numeric}}{\code{vector} of target values for each feature.
Additionally, for convenience, this type of argument can be a single
value to assign the same target to each feature. Note that this type of
argument cannot be used to specify targets for problems with multiple
zones.}

\item{\code{matrix}}{containing a target for each feature in each zone.
Here, each row corresponds to a different feature in argument to
\code{x}, each column corresponds to a different zone in argument to
\code{x}, and each cell contains the target value for a given feature
that the solution needs to secure in a given zone.}

\item{\code{character}}{containing the names of fields (columns) in the
feature data associated with the argument to \code{x} that contain
targets. This type of argument can only be used when the
feature data associated with \code{x} is a \code{data.frame}.
This argument must contain a field (column) name for each zone.}

}

For problems associated with multiple management zones, this function can
be used to set targets that each pertain to a single feature and a single
zone. To set targets which can be met through allocating different
planning units to multiple zones, see the \code{\link[=add_manual_targets]{add_manual_targets()}}
function. An example of a target that could be met through allocations
to multiple zones might be where each management zone is expected to
result in a different amount of a feature and the target requires that
the total amount of the feature in all zones must exceed a certain
threshold. In other words, the target does not require that any single
zone secure a specific amount of the feature, but the total amount held
in all zones must secure a specific amount. Thus the target could,
potentially, be met through allocating all planning units to any specific
management zone, or through allocating the planning units to different
combinations of management zones.
