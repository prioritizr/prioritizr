\description{
Add targets to a conservation planning problem expressed as the actual value
of features in the study area that need to be represented in the
prioritization. For example,
setting a target of 10 requires that the solution secure a set of
planning units for which their summed feature values are equal to or greater
than 10.
}
\details{
This function is used to set targets for each feature (separately).
For problems associated with a single management zone, this function
may be useful to specify individual targets for each feature.
For problems associated with multiple management zones, this function
can also be used to specify a target for each feature within each zone
(separately). For example, this may be useful in planning exercises
where it is important to ensure that some of the features are adequately
represented by multiple zones. For example, in a marine spatial planning
exercise, it may be important for some features (e.g., commercial
important fish species) to be adequately represented by a conservation zone
for ensuring their long-term persistence, and also by a fishing zone to
for ensure food security. For greater flexibility in target setting
(such as setting targets that can be met through the allocation of
multiple zones), see the \code{\link[=add_manual_targets]{add_manual_targets()}} function.
}
\section{Targets format}{

The \code{targets} for a problem can be specified using the following formats.

\describe{

\item{\code{targets} as a \code{numeric} vector}{containing target values for each
feature.
Additionally, for convenience, this format can be a single
value to assign the same target to each feature. Note that this format
cannot be used to specify targets for problems with multiple zones.}

\item{\code{targets} as a \code{matrix} object}{containing a target for each feature
in each zone.
Here, each row corresponds to a different feature in argument to
\code{x}, each column corresponds to a different zone in argument to
\code{x}, and each cell contains the target value for a given feature
that the solution needs to secure in a given zone.}

\item{\code{targets} as a \code{character} vector}{containing the column name(s) in the
feature data associated with the argument to \code{x} that
contain targets. This format can only be used when the
feature data associated with \code{x} is a \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or \code{data.frame}.
For problems that contain a single zone, the argument to \code{targets} must
contain a single column name. Otherwise, for problems that
contain multiple zones, the argument to \code{targets} must
contain a column name for each zone.}

}
}

\section{Target setting}{

Many conservation planning problems require targets.
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount, or proportion, of a
feature's spatial distribution that should ideally be protected.
This is important so that the optimization process can weigh the merits
and trade-offs between improving the representation of one feature over
another feature.
Although it can be challenging to set meaningful targets,
this is a critical step for ensuring that prioritizations
meet the stakeholder objectives that underpin a prioritization exercise
(Carwardine \emph{et al.} 2009).
In other words, targets play an important role in ensuring that a
priority setting process is properly tuned according to stakeholder
requirements.
For example, targets provide a mechanism for ensuring that a
prioritization secures enough habitat to promote the long-term persistence
of each threatened species, culturally important species,
or economically important ecosystem service under consideration.
Since there is often uncertainty regarding stakeholder objectives
(e.g., how much habitat should be protected for a given species)
or the influence of particular target on a prioritization
(e.g., how would setting a 90\% or 100\% for a threatened species alter
priorities), it is often useful to generate and compare a suite of
prioritizations based on different target scenarios.
