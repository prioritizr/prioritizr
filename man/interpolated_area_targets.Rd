\value{
An object (\code{\linkS4class{Method}}) for specifying targets.
}
\description{
Specify targets by interpolating them between area-based thresholds.
This function is designed to be used within \code{add_auto_targets()}.
}
\details{
This method has been applied to set target thresholds at global and national
scales (e.g., Butchart \emph{et al.} 2015;
Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2004; Polak *et al.*2015).
It is based on the rationale that species with a smaller geographic
distribution are at a greater risk of extinction, and so require
a larger percentage of their geographic distribution to be represented
by a prioritization (Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2004).
When using this method in a planning exercise, it is important to ensure
that the threshold parameters reflect the stakeholder objectives.
Additionally, the threshold parameters may need to calibrated based on
the spatial extent of the planning region.
}
\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method provides a flexible approach for setting target thresholds based
on the spatial extent of the features.
To express this mathematically, we will define the following terminology.
Let \eqn{f} denote the total spatial extent of a feature (e.g., geographic
range size),
\eqn{a} the threshold for identifying rare features
(per \code{rare_area_threshold}),
\eqn{b} the relative targets for rare features
(per \code{rare_relative_target}),
\eqn{c} the area-based targets for rare features
(per \code{rare_area_target}),
\eqn{d()} the function for calculating targets for rare features
as a maximum or minimum value (per \code{rare_method}).
\eqn{e} the threshold for identifying common features
(per \code{common_area_threshold}),
\eqn{g} the relative targets for common features
(per \code{common_relative_target}),
\eqn{h} the area-based targets for common features
(per \code{common_area_target}),
\eqn{i()} the method for calculating targets for common features
as a maximum or minimum value  (per \code{common_method}).
\eqn{j} the target cap (per \code{cap_area_target}).
\eqn{k()} the interpolation method for features with a spatial distribution
that is larger than a rare features and smaller than a common feature
(per \code{interp_method}).
In particular, \eqn{j()} is either a linear or log-linear interpolation
procedure based on the thresholds for identifying rare and common features
as well as the relative targets for rare and common features.
Given this terminology, the target threshold (\eqn{t}) for a feature
is calculated as follows.
\itemize{
\item If \eqn{f < a}, then \eqn{t = min(d(c, b * f), j)}.
\item If \eqn{f > e}, then \eqn{t = min(i(h, g * f), j)}.
\item If \eqn{a <= f <= e}, then \eqn{t = min(k(f, a, b, e, g), j)}.
}
}

\section{Target setting}{

Many conservation planning problems require targets.
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount, or proportion, of a
feature's spatial distribution that should ideally be protected.
This is important so that the optimization process can weigh the merits
and trade-offs between improving the representation of one feature over
another feature.
Although it can be challenging to set meaningful targets,
this is a critical step for ensuring that prioritizations
meet the stakeholder objectives that underpin a prioritization exercise
(Carwardine \emph{et al.} 2009).
In other words, targets play an important role in ensuring that a
priority setting process is properly tuned according to stakeholder
requirements.
For example, targets provide a mechanism for ensuring that a
prioritization secures enough habitat to promote the long-term persistence
of each threatened species, culturally important species,
or economically important ecosystem service under consideration.
Since there is often uncertainty regarding stakeholder objectives
(e.g., how much habitat should be protected for a given species)
or the influence of particular target on a prioritization
(e.g., how would setting a 90\% or 100\% for a threatened species alter
priorities), it is often useful to generate and compare a suite of
prioritizations based on different target scenarios.
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
As such, this function may need to make particular assumptions depending
on the data used to specify the planning units and features in \code{x}.
If possible, when building \code{x} with \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}, it is recommended to specify
\code{features} as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object to ensure correctness.
Although this function can be used to specify targets for features
in other data formats, you must take care to ensure that the information
specifying the amount of each feature are in units of 1 km
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
To help ensure that you are aware of this limitation, this function will
produce a warning to alert you when the features in \code{x} belong to such
data formats.
If you are confident that your data are in the correct units,
then you can safely ignore this warning.
Below we provide details for ensuring that the targets are calculated
correctly.

\describe{
\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} planning units and \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} features}{
This function will automatically ensure that the targets are calculated
correctly. Given this, it is recommended to specify \code{features} in either
of these when building a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{character} features}{
Here, the argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify
which columns of the planning unit data denote the amount of each feature
present within each planning unit.
All of these columns must contain values in
units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
For example, if \code{features = c("spp1", "spp2", "spp3")}, then the columns
\code{"spp1"}, \code{"spp2"}, and \code{"spp3"} of the planning unit denote data the amount
of the first, second, and third features (respectively) present within each
planning unit. If the column \code{"spp1"} has a value of 5 in the first row
of the planning unit data, then this means the first planning unit
contains 5 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}
of habitat for the feature \code{"spp1"}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij} must contain a \code{data.frame}
with the columns \code{"pu"}, \code{"species"}, \code{"amount"}. For a given row,
the \code{"pu"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the identifier
for the planning unit,
the \code{"species"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the
identifier for the feature,
and \verb{"amount" contains a }numeric\verb{value denoting the amount of the the feature (per the}"species"\verb{column) that is present in the planning unit (per}"pu"\verb{column). Given this, the "amount" column must contain values that in units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}. For example, if the argument to}rij\verb{has a row where the}"pu"\verb{column has a value of 1, the}"species"\verb{column has a value of 2, and the}"amount"` column has a value of 3: then this means that the
planning unit with an identifier of 1 contains 3
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of the feature
associated with the identifier of 2.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{numeric} or \code{matrix} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij_matrix} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij_matrix} must contain a \code{matrix}
(or \code{list} of \code{matrix} objects) that contains \code{numeric} values in units of 1
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
