\title{Add binary decisions}
\usage{
add_binary_decisions(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=ConservationProblem-class]{ConservationProblem-class()}} object.}
}
\value{
\code{\link[=ConservationProblem-class]{ConservationProblem-class()}} object with the decisions
added to it.
}
\description{
Add a binary decision to a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
This is the classic decision of either prioritizing or not prioritizing a
planning unit. Typically, this decision has the assumed action of buying
the planning unit to include in a protected area network. If no decision is
added to a problem then this decision class will be used by default.
}
\details{
Conservation planning problems involve making decisions on planning
units. These decisions are then associated with actions (e.g. turning a
planning unit into a protected area). If no decision is explicitly added to
a problem, then the binary decision class will be used by default. Only a
single decision should be added to a \code{ConservationProblem} object.
\strong{If multiple decisions are added to a problem object, then the last
one to be added will be used.}
