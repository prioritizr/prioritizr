\usage{
\S4method{connectivity_matrix}{Spatial,character}(x, y,
  boundary_data = NULL, ...)

\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} or
\code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}} object representing planning units. If
\code{x} is a \code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object then it must
contain a single band.}

\item{y}{\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object showing the conductance
of different areas across the study area, or a \code{character} object
denoting a column name in the attribute table of \code{x} that contains
the conductance values. Note that argument to \code{y} can only be a
\code{character} object if the argument to \code{x} is a
\code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}} object. Additionally, note that if
argument to \code{x} is a \code{\link{Raster-class}} object then
argument to \code{y} must have the same spatial properties as it
(ie. coordinate system, extent, resolution).}

\item{boundary_data}{\code{\link[Matrix]{dsCMatrix-class}} object containing
the shared boundary lengths between planning units. This argument defaults
to \code{NULL} so that the boundary data will be automatically calculated.}

\item{included}{\code{integer} \code{vector} indicating which cells in argument
to \code{x} are planning units. This argument is only used when \code{x}
is a \code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object. It defaults to \code{NULL}
so that the cell indices are calculated automatically.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to \code{\link{fast_extract}} for extracting
and calculating the conductance for each unit. These arguments
are only used if argument to \code{x} is a \code{link[sp]{Spatial-class}}
object and argument to \code{y} is a \code{\link{Raster-class}}
object.}
}
\value{
\code{\link[Matrix]{dsCMatrix-class}} sparse symmetric matrix object.
}
\description{
Create a matrix showing the connectivity between planning units. Connectivity
is calculated as the average conductance of two planning units multiplied
by the amount of shared boundary between the two planning units. Thus
planning units that each have higher a conductance and share a greater
boundary are associated with greater connectivity.
}
\details{
This function returns a \code{\link[Matrix]{dsCMatrix-class}}
  sparse symmetric matrix. Each row and column represents a planning unit.
  Cell values represent the connectivity between two planning units. To
  reduce computational burden, if argument to \code{x} is a
  \code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object then cells in \code{x} that
  contain missing (\code{NA}) values are omitted from the returned matrix.
  Furthermore, all cells along the diagonal are missing values since
  a planing unit does not have any share connectivity with itself.
