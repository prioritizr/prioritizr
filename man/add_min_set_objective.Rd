\description{
Set the objective of a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} to
minimize the cost of the solution whilst ensuring that all targets are met.
This objective is similar to that used in
\emph{Marxan} and is detailed in Rodrigues \emph{et al.} (2000).
}
\details{
A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
conservation planning problem. Please note that all conservation
planning problems formulated in the \pkg{prioritizr} package require the
addition of objectives---failing to do so will return an error
message when attempting to solve problem.

In the context of systematic reserve design, the minimum set objective
seeks to find the set of planning units that minimizes the overall cost of
a reserve network, while meeting a set of representation targets for the
conservation features. This objective is equivalent to a simplified
\emph{Marxan} reserve design problem with the Boundary Length Modifier
(BLM) set to zero.

The minimum set objective for the reserve design problem can be expressed
mathematically for a set of planning units (\eqn{I}{I} indexed by
\eqn{i}{i}) and a set of features (\eqn{J}{J} indexed by \eqn{j}{j}) as:

\deqn{\mathit{Minimize} \space \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i c_i \\
  \mathit{subject \space to} \\
  \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i r_{ij} \geq T_j \space \forall \space j \in J}{
  Minimize sum_i^I (xi * ci) subject to sum_i^I (xi * rij) >= Tj for all
  j in J}

Here, \eqn{x_i}{xi} is the \link{decisions} variable (e.g.
specifying whether planning unit \eqn{i}{i} has been selected (1) or not
(0)), \eqn{c_i}{ci} is the cost of planning unit \eqn{i}{i},
\eqn{r_{ij}}{rij} is the amount of feature \eqn{j}{j} in planning unit
\eqn{i}{i}, and \eqn{T_j}{Tj} is the target for feature \eqn{j}{j}. The
first term is the objective function and the second is the set of
constraints. In words this says find the set of planning units that meets
all the representation targets while minimizing the overall cost.
