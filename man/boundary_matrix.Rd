\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} object representing planning units.}

\item{...}{not used.}
}
\value{
A \code{\linkS4class{dsCMatrix}} symmetric sparse matrix object.
Each row and column represents a planning unit.
Cell values indicate the shared boundary length between different pairs
of planning units. Values along the matrix diagonal indicate the
total perimeter associated with each planning unit.
}
\description{
Generate a matrix describing the amount of shared boundary length
between different planning units, and the amount of exposed edge length each
planning unit exhibits.
}
\details{
This function returns a \code{\linkS4class{dsCMatrix}}
symmetric sparse matrix. Cells on the off-diagonal indicate the length of
the shared boundary between two different planning units. Cells on the
diagonal indicate length of a given planning unit's edges that have no
neighbors (e.g., for edges of planning units found along the
coastline). \strong{This function assumes the data are in a coordinate
system where Euclidean distances accurately describe the proximity
between two points on the earth}. Thus spatial data in a
longitude/latitude coordinate system (i.e.,
\href{https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/}{WGS84})
should be reprojected to another coordinate system before using this
function. Note that for \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} objects
boundaries are missing for cells that have \code{NA} values in all cells.
}
\section{Notes}{

In earlier versions, this function had an extra \code{str_tree} parameter
that could be used to leverage STR query trees to speed up processing
for planning units in vector format.
Although this functionality improved performance, it was not
enabled by default because the underlying function
(i.e., \code{rgeos:gUnarySTRtreeQuery()}) was documented as experimental.
The \code{boundary_matrix()} function has since been updated so that it will
use STR query trees to speed up processing for planning units in vector
format (using \code{\link[terra:sharedPaths]{terra::sharedPaths()}}).

Also, note that in previous versions, cell values along the matrix
diagonal indicated the perimeter associated with planning units
that did not contain any neighbors. This has now changed such
that values along the diagonal now correspond to the total
perimeter associated with each planning unit.
