If a single \code{numeric} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming the same variance in population
growth rate.
See Population data section for more details.}

\item{pop_density}{\code{numeric} vector that specifies the population density

See Population density section for more details.}

\item{density_units}{\code{character} vector that specifies the area-based units
for the population density values. For example, units can be used to
express that population densities are in terms of individuals per hectare
(\verb{"ha"), acre (}"acre"\verb{), or \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} (}km^2\verb{). If a single }character` value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming that population density values
are in the same units.

\item{cap_area_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the area-based target cap.
To avoid setting a target cap, a missing (\code{NA}) value can be specified.
Defaults to 1000000

\item{area_units}{\code{character} value denoting the unit of measurement
for the area-based arguments.

\description{
Specify targets based on the methodology outlined by
Wilson \emph{et al.} (2010).
Briefly, this method involves using population growth rate data to set
target thresholds based on the amount
of habitat required to sustain populations for 100,000 years.
To help prevent widespread features from obscuring priorities,
targets are capped following Butchart \emph{et al.} (2015).
Note that this function is designed to be used within \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}.
}
\details{
This target setting method was developed to identify the minimum amount
of habitat to protect an entire species (Wilson \emph{et al.} 2010).
Although this method was originally applied to the sub-national scale
(i.e., the East Kalimantan province of Indonesia), Wilson \emph{et al.} (2010)
linearly re-scaled targets derived from this method according to the
proportion of each species' distribution located within the study area
(i.e., based on the species' total distribution size in Borneo).
As such, this method may especially well-suited for national or global-scale
conservation planning exercises, and may also be useful for local-scale
planning exercises as long as the targets are re-scaled appropriately.
Please note that this function is provided as convenient method to
set targets for problems with a single management zone, and cannot
be used for those with multiple management zones.

\section{Population data}{

Although the package does not provide population growth rate data,
such data can be obtained from published databases or approximated
from physiological trait databases.
For example, Wilson \emph{et al.} (2010) detail calculations to approximate
average population growth rate and variance in population growth rate
for mammal species based on body mass, and Santini \emph{et al.} (2022) provide
body mass data for mammal species globally.
}

\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method involves setting target thresholds based on the amount of habitat
required to sustain populations for 100,000 years.
To express this mathematically, we will define the following terminology.
Let \eqn{f} denote the total abundance of a feature (i.e., geographic
range size expressed as \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}),
\eqn{k} the carrying capacity required for a population to persist for
100,000 years,
\eqn{d} the population density of the feature
(i.e.,
number of individuals per \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}},
per \code{pop_density} and \code{density_units}),
\eqn{r} the mean population growth rate of the feature,
\eqn{sigma^2} the variance in population growth rate of the feature,
\eqn{b} is a constant calculated from \eqn{r} and \eqn{sigma^2},
, and \eqn{j} the target cap (expressed as
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}, per \code{cap_area_target}).
Given this terminology, the target threshold (\eqn{t}) for a feature
is calculated as follows.
\deqn{
t = min(f, min(j, d \times k)) \\
k = (\frac{100000 \times \sigma^2 \times b^2}{2})^\frac{1}{b} \\
b = (2 \times \frac{r}{\sigma^2}) - 1
}{
t = min(f, min(j, d \times k)),
k = ((100000 * sigma^2 * b^2) / 2)^(1/b),
b = (2 * r/sigma^2) - 1
}
}

\section{Population density}{

Population density data are expressed as number of individuals per
unit area. For example, if a species has 200 individuals per hectare,
then this can be specified with \code{pop_density = 200} and
\code{density_units = "ha"}.
Alternatively, if a species has a population density where one individual
occurs every 10 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}, then
this can be specified with \code{pop_density = 0.1} and \code{density_units = "km^2"}.
Also, note that
population density is assumed to scale linearly with the values
in the feature data. For example, if a planning unit contains
5 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of habitat for a feature,
\code{pop_density = 200}, and \code{density_units = "km^2"},
then the calculations assume that the planning unit contains 100 individuals
for the species.
Although the package does not provide the population density
data required to apply this target setting method, such data can be
obtained from published databases
(e.g., Santini \emph{et al.} 2022, 2023, 2024; Witting \emph{et al.} 2024).
}

\section{Target setting}{

Many conservation planning problems require targets.
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount, or proportion, of a
feature's spatial distribution that should ideally be protected.
This is important so that the optimization process can weigh the merits
and trade-offs between improving the representation of one feature over
another feature.
Although it can be challenging to set meaningful targets,
this is a critical step for ensuring that prioritizations
meet the stakeholder objectives that underpin a prioritization exercise
(Carwardine \emph{et al.} 2009).
In other words, targets play an important role in ensuring that a
priority setting process is properly tuned according to stakeholder
requirements.
For example, targets provide a mechanism for ensuring that a
prioritization secures enough habitat to promote the long-term persistence
of each threatened species, culturally important species,
or economically important ecosystem service under consideration.
Since there is often uncertainty regarding stakeholder objectives
(e.g., how much habitat should be protected for a given species)
or the influence of particular target on a prioritization
(e.g., how would setting a 90\% or 100\% for a threatened species alter
priorities), it is often useful to generate and compare a suite of
prioritizations based on different target scenarios.
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
Although it can be readily applied to \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects that
have the feature data provided as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object,
you will need to specify the spatial units for the features
when initializing the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects if the feature data
are provided in a different format. In particular, if the feature
data are provided as a \code{data.frame} or \code{character} object,
then you will need to specify an argument to \code{feature_units} when
using the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} function. See the Examples section below for a
demonstration of using the \code{feature_units} parameter.
