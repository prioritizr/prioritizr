\arguments{
\item{mean_growth_rates}{\code{numeric} vector that specifies the average
population growth rate that would be expected for each
feature within priority areas
(i.e., \eqn{r} per Wilson \emph{et al.} 2010).
If a single \code{numeric} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets based on the same average population growth
rate.
See Population growth section for more details.}

\item{var_growth_rates}{\code{numeric} vector that specifies the
variance in population growth rate that would be expected for each
feature within priority areas
(i.e., \eqn{\sigma^2} per Wilson \emph{et al.} 2010).
If a single \code{numeric} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming the same variance in population
growth rate.
See Population growth section for more details.}

\item{pop_density}{\code{numeric} vector that specifies the population density
for each feature. If a single \code{numeric} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming the same population density.
See Population density section for more details.}

\item{density_units}{\code{character} vector that specifies the area-based units
for the population density values. For example, units can be used to
express that population densities are in terms of individuals per hectare
(\code{"ha"}), acre (\code{"acre"}), or
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} (\code{"km^2"}).
If a single \code{character} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming that population density values
are in the same units.
See Population density section for more details.}

\item{cap_area_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the area-based target cap.
To avoid setting a target cap, a missing (\code{NA}) value can be specified.
Defaults to 1000000
(i.e., 1,000,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{area_units}{\code{character} value denoting the unit of measurement
for the area-based arguments.
Defaults to \code{"km^2"}
(i.e., \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}
}

An object (\code{\linkS4class{Method}}) for specifying targets that
can be used with \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}

\description{
Specify targets based on the methodology outlined by
Wilson \emph{et al.} (2010).
Briefly, this method involves using population growth rate data to set
target thresholds based on the amount
of habitat required to sustain populations for 100,000 years.
To help prevent widespread features from obscuring priorities,
targets are capped following Butchart \emph{et al.} (2015).
Note that this function is designed to be used with \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}.
}
\details{
This target setting method was developed to identify the minimum amount
of habitat to protect an entire species (Wilson \emph{et al.} 2010).
Although this method was originally applied to the sub-national scale
(i.e., the East Kalimantan province of Indonesia), Wilson \emph{et al.} (2010)
linearly re-scaled targets derived from this method according to the
proportion of each species' distribution located within the study area
(i.e., based on the species' total distribution size in Borneo).
As such, this method may especially well-suited for national or global-scale
conservation planning exercises, and may also be useful for local-scale
planning exercises as long as the targets are re-scaled appropriately.
Please note that this function is provided as convenient method to
set targets for problems with a single management zone, and cannot
be used for those with multiple management zones.
}
\section{Population growth}{

This method requires population growth rate data.
Although the package does not provide such data,
population growth rate estimates can be obtained from published datasets
(e.g., Brook \emph{et al.} 2006).
Additionally, population growth rate data may be approximated from
physiological traits
(e.g., such as body mass, Sinclair 1996; Hilbers \emph{et al.} 2016).
Indeed, Wilson \emph{et al.} (2010) detail equations for approximating
average population growth rate and variance in population growth rate
for mammal species based on body mass (based on Sinclair 1996).
}

\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method involves setting target thresholds based on the amount of habitat
required to sustain populations for 100,000 years.
To express this mathematically, we will define the following terminology.
Let \eqn{f} denote the total abundance of a feature (i.e., geographic
range size expressed as \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}),
\eqn{k} the carrying capacity required for a population to persist for
100,000 years,
\eqn{d} the population density of the feature
(i.e.,
number of individuals per \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}},
per \code{pop_density} and \code{density_units}),
\eqn{r} the mean population growth rate of the feature
inside protected areas (per \code{mean_growth_rates}),
\eqn{\sigma^2} the variance in population growth rate of the feature
inside protected areas (per \code{var_growth_rates}),
\eqn{b} is a constant calculated from \eqn{r} and \eqn{\sigma^2},
and \eqn{j} the target cap (expressed as
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}},
per \code{cap_area_target} and \code{area_units}).
Given this terminology, the target threshold (\eqn{t}) for the feature
is calculated as follows.
\deqn{
t = min(f, min(j, d \times k)) \\
k = (\frac{100000 \times \sigma^2 \times b^2}{2})^\frac{1}{b} \\
b = (2 \times \frac{r}{\sigma^2}) - 1
}{
t = min(f, min(j, d \times k)),
k = ((100000 * sigma^2 * b^2) / 2)^(1/b),
b = (2 * r/sigma^2) - 1
}
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
Although it can be readily applied to \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects that
have the feature data provided as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object,
you will need to specify the spatial units for the features
when initializing the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects if the feature data
are provided in a different format. In particular, if the feature
data are provided as a \code{data.frame} or \code{character} vector,
then you will need to specify an argument to \code{feature_units} when
using the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} function.
See the Examples section of the documentation for \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
for a demonstration of specifying the spatial units for features.
}

\section{Population density}{

This method requires population density data expressed as the number of
individuals per unit area.
For example, if a species has 200 individuals per hectare,
then this can be specified with \code{pop_density = 200} and
\code{density_units = "ha"}.
Alternatively, if a species has a population density where one individual
occurs every 10 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}, then
this can be specified with \code{pop_density = 0.1} and \code{density_units = "km^2"}.
Also, note that
population density is assumed to scale linearly with the values
in the feature data. For example, if a planning unit contains
5 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of habitat for a feature,
\code{pop_density = 200}, and \code{density_units = "km^2"},
then the calculations assume that the planning unit contains 100 individuals
for the species.
Although the package does not provide the population density
data required to apply this target setting method, such data can be
obtained from published databases
(e.g., Santini \emph{et al.} 2022, 2023, 2024; Witting \emph{et al.} 2024).
