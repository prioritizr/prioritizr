\item{mean_growth_rates}{\code{numeric} vector that specifies the average
population growth rate that would be expected for each
feature within priority areas
(i.e., \eqn{r} per Wilson \emph{et al.} 2010).
If a single \code{numeric} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets based on the same average population growth
rate.
See Population data section for more details.}

\item{var_growth_rates}{\code{numeric} vector that specifies the
variance in population growth rate that would be expected for each
feature within priority areas
(i.e., \eqn{\sigma^2} per Wilson \emph{et al.} 2010).
If a single \code{numeric} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming the same variance in population
growth rate.
See Population data section for more details.}

\item{pop_density}{\code{numeric} vector that specifies the population density
for each feature. If a single \code{numeric} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming the same population density factor.
See Population density section for more details.}

\item{density_units}{\code{character} vector that specifies the area-based units
for the population density values. For example, units can be used to
express that population densities are in terms of individuals per hectare
(\verb{"ha"), acre (}"acre"\verb{), or \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} (}km^2\verb{). If a single }character` value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming that population density values
are in the same units.
See Population density section for more details.}

\item{cap_area_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the area-based target cap.
To avoid setting a target cap, a missing (\code{NA}) value can be specified.
Defaults to 1000000
(i.e., 1,000,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{area_units}{\code{character} value denoting the unit of measurement
for the area-based arguments.

\description{
Specify targets based on the methodology outlined by
Wilson \emph{et al.} (2010).
Briefly, this method involves using population growth rate data to set
target thresholds based on the amount
of habitat required to sustain populations for 100,000 years.
Note that this function is designed to be used within \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}.
}
\details{
This target setting method was developed to identify the minimum amount
of habitat to protect an entire species (Wilson \emph{et al.} 2010).
Although this method was originally applied to the sub-national scale
(i.e., the East Kalimantan province of Indonesia), Wilson \emph{et al.} (2010)
linearly re-scaled targets derived from this method according to the
proportion of each species' distribution located within the study area
(i.e., based on the species' total distribution size in Borneo).
As such, this method may especially well-suited for national or global-scale
conservation planning exercises, and may also be useful for local-scale
planning exercises as long as the targets are re-scaled appropriately.
Please note that this function is provided as convenient method to
set targets for problems with a single management zone, and cannot
be used for those with multiple management zones.

\section{Population data}{

Although the package does not provide population growth rate data,
such data can be obtained from published databases or approximated
from physiological trait databases.
For example, Wilson \emph{et al.} (2010) detail calculations to approximate
average population growth rate and variance in population growth rate
for mammal species based on body mass, and Santini \emph{et al.} (2022) provide
body mass data for mammal species globally.
}

\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method involves setting target thresholds based on the amount of habitat
required to sustain populations for 100,000 years.
To express this mathematically, we will define the following terminology.
Let \eqn{f} denote the total abundance of a feature (i.e., geographic
range size expressed as \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}),
\eqn{k} the carrying capacity required for a population to persist for
100,000 years,
\eqn{d} the population density of the feature
(i.e.,
number of individuals per \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}},
per \code{pop_density} and \code{density_units}),
\eqn{r} the mean population growth rate of the feature,
\eqn{sigma^2} the variance in population growth rate of the feature,
\eqn{b} is a constant calculated from \eqn{r} and \eqn{sigma^2},
, and \eqn{j} the target cap (expressed as
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}, per \code{cap_area_target}).
Given this terminology, the target threshold (\eqn{t}) for a feature
is calculated as follows.
\deqn{
t = min(f, min(j, d \times k)) \\
k = (\frac{100000 \times \sigma^2 \times b^2}{2})^\frac{1}{b} \\
b = (2 \times \frac{r}{\sigma^2}) - 1
}{
t = min(f, min(j, d \times k)),
k = ((100000 * sigma^2 * b^2) / 2)^(1/b),
b = (2 * r/sigma^2) - 1
}
}

\section{Population density}{

Population density data are expressed as number of individuals per
unit area. For example, if a species has 200 individuals per hectare,
then this can be specified with \code{pop_density = 200} and
\code{density_units = "ha"}.
Alternatively, if a species has a population density where one individual
occurs every 10 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}, then
this can be specified with \code{pop_density = 0.1} and \code{density_units = "km^2"}.
Also, note that
population density is assumed to scale linearly with the values
in the feature data. For example, if a planning unit contains
5 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of habitat for a feature,
\code{pop_density = 200}, and \code{density_units = "km^2"},
then the calculations assume that the planning unit contains 100 individuals
for the species.
Although the package does not provide the population density
data required to apply this target setting method, such data can be
obtained from published databases
(e.g., Santini \emph{et al.} 2022, 2023, 2024; Witting \emph{et al.} 2024).
}

\section{Target setting}{

Many conservation planning problems require targets.
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount, or proportion, of a
feature's spatial distribution that should ideally be protected.
This is important so that the optimization process can weigh the merits
and trade-offs between improving the representation of one feature over
another feature.
Although it can be challenging to set meaningful targets,
this is a critical step for ensuring that prioritizations
meet the stakeholder objectives that underpin a prioritization exercise
(Carwardine \emph{et al.} 2009).
In other words, targets play an important role in ensuring that a
priority setting process is properly tuned according to stakeholder
requirements.
For example, targets provide a mechanism for ensuring that a
prioritization secures enough habitat to promote the long-term persistence
of each threatened species, culturally important species,
or economically important ecosystem service under consideration.
Since there is often uncertainty regarding stakeholder objectives
(e.g., how much habitat should be protected for a given species)
or the influence of particular target on a prioritization
(e.g., how would setting a 90\% or 100\% for a threatened species alter
priorities), it is often useful to generate and compare a suite of
prioritizations based on different target scenarios.
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
As such, this function may need to make particular assumptions depending
on the data used to specify the planning units and features in \code{x}.
If possible, when building \code{x} with \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}, it is recommended to specify
\code{features} as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object to ensure correctness.
Although this function can be used to specify targets for features
in other data formats, you must take care to ensure that the information
specifying the amount of each feature are in units of 1 km
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
To help ensure that you are aware of this limitation, this function will
produce a warning to alert you when the features in \code{x} belong to such
data formats.
If you are confident that your data are in the correct units,
then you can safely ignore this warning.
Below we provide details for ensuring that the targets are calculated
correctly.

\describe{
\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} planning units and \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} features}{
This function will automatically ensure that the targets are calculated
correctly. Given this, it is recommended to specify \code{features} in either
of these when building a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{character} features}{
Here, the argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify
which columns of the planning unit data denote the amount of each feature
present within each planning unit.
All of these columns must contain values in
units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
For example, if \code{features = c("spp1", "spp2", "spp3")}, then the columns
\code{"spp1"}, \code{"spp2"}, and \code{"spp3"} of the planning unit denote data the amount
of the first, second, and third features (respectively) present within each
planning unit. If the column \code{"spp1"} has a value of 5 in the first row
of the planning unit data, then this means the first planning unit
contains 5 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}
of habitat for the feature \code{"spp1"}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij} must contain a \code{data.frame}
with the columns \code{"pu"}, \code{"species"}, \code{"amount"}. For a given row,
the \code{"pu"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the identifier
for the planning unit,
the \code{"species"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the
identifier for the feature,
and \verb{"amount" contains a }numeric\verb{value denoting the amount of the the feature (per the}"species"\verb{column) that is present in the planning unit (per}"pu"\verb{column). Given this, the "amount" column must contain values that in units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}. For example, if the argument to}rij\verb{has a row where the}"pu"\verb{column has a value of 1, the}"species"\verb{column has a value of 2, and the}"amount"` column has a value of 3: then this means that the
planning unit with an identifier of 1 contains 3
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of the feature
associated with the identifier of 2.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{numeric} or \code{matrix} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij_matrix} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij_matrix} must contain a \code{matrix}
(or \code{list} of \code{matrix} objects) that contains \code{numeric} values in units of 1
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
