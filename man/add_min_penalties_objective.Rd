\usage{
add_min_penalties_objective(x, budget)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object.}

\item{budget}{\code{numeric} value specifying the maximum expenditure of
the prioritization. For problems with multiple zones, the argument
to \code{budget} can be (i) a single \code{numeric} value to specify a single budget
for the entire solution or (ii) a \code{numeric} vector to specify
a separate budget for each management zone.}

\value{
An updated \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object with the objective added to it.

\description{
Set the objective of a conservation planning problem to
only minimize the penalties added to the problem, whilst ensuring that all
\link{targets} are met and the cost of the solution does not exceed a budget.
This objective is useful when using a hierarchical approach for
multi-objective optimization.
}
\details{
The minimum penalty objective is designed to be used with problems
that have penalties (see \link{penalties} for details). It can be used
to generate solutions that focus entirely on minimizing the penalties,
whilst ensuring that certain constraints are met.
This is is useful when performing multi-objective optimization using a
hierarchical approach (see examples below). Although previous versions of the
package recommended using the minimum set objective (i.e.,
\code{\link[=add_min_set_objective]{add_min_set_objective()}}) with zero costs and linear constraints for this
purpose, the minimum penalty objective provides a dedicated objective
for performing hierarchical multi-objective optimization.

\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This objective can be expressed
mathematically for a set of planning units (\eqn{I}{I} indexed by
\eqn{i}{i}) and a set of features (\eqn{J}{J} indexed by \eqn{j}{j}) as:

\deqn{\mathit{Minimize} \space 0 \\
\mathit{subject \space to} \\
\sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i r_{ij} \geq T_j \space \forall \space j \in J \\
\sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i c_i \leq B}{
Minimize sum_i^I (xi * ci) subject to
sum_i^I (xi * rij) >= Tj for all j in J &
sum_i^I (xi * ci) <= B}

Here, \eqn{x_i}{xi} is the \link{decisions} variable (e.g.,
specifying whether planning unit \eqn{i}{i} has been selected (1) or not
(0)), \eqn{c_i}{ci} is the cost of planning unit \eqn{i}{i},
\eqn{r_{ij}}{rij} is the amount of feature \eqn{j}{j} in planning unit
\eqn{i}{i}, and \eqn{T_j}{Tj} is the target for feature \eqn{j}{j}. Since
the objective is to minimize zero, this function does not actually provide
any criteria to compare competing solutions. As such, when used in
conjunction with a penalty function (see \link{penalties}), only the penalty
(e.g., \code{\link[=add_boundary_penalties]{add_boundary_penalties()}}) will be used to compare competing
solutions during optimization.
