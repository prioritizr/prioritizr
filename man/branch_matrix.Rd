\usage{
branch_matrix(x)

\method{branch_matrix}{default}(x)

\method{branch_matrix}{phylo}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[ape:read.tree]{ape::phylo()}} tree object.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[Matrix:dgCMatrix-class]{Matrix::dgCMatrix}} sparse matrix object. Each row
corresponds to a different species. Each column corresponds to a different
branch. Species that inherit from a given branch are denoted with a one.
}
\description{
Phylogenetic trees depict the evolutionary relationships between different
species. Each branch in a phylogenetic tree represents a period of
evolutionary history. Species that are connected to the same branch
both share that same period of evolutionary history. This function creates
a matrix that shows which species are connected with branch. In other words,
it creates a matrix that shows which periods of evolutionary history
each species have experienced.
}
\examples{
# load data
sim_phylogeny <- get_sim_phylogeny()

# generate species by branch matrix
m <- branch_matrix(sim_phylogeny)

# plot data
\dontrun{
plot(sim_phylogeny, main = "phylogeny")
Matrix::image(m, main = "branch matrix")
}
}
