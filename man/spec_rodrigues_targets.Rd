\arguments{
\item{rare_area_threshold}{\code{numeric} value indicating the threshold area
for rare identifying rare features.
Defaults to 1000 (i.e., 1000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{rare_relative_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the
relative target for features with a spatial distribution
that is smaller than \code{rare_threshold}.
Note that this value must be a proportion between 0 and 1.
Defaults to 1 (i.e., 100\%).}

\item{common_area_threshold}{\code{numeric} value indicating the threshold area
for identifying common features.
Defaults to 250000
(i.e., 250,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{common_relative_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the
relative target for features with a spatial distribution
that is greater than \code{common_threshold}.
Defaults to 0.1 (i.e., 10\%).
Since this default value is based on historical levels of global protected
area coverage, it may be appropriate to set this value based on current
levels of protected area coverage (e.g., 17.6\% for terrestrial and 8.4\% for
marine systems globally; UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2025).}

\item{cap_area_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the area-based target cap.
To avoid setting a target cap, a missing (\code{NA}) value can be specified.
Defaults to 1000000
(i.e., 1,000,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{area_units}{\code{character} value denoting the unit of measurement
for the area-based arguments.
Defaults to \code{"km^2"}
(i.e., \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

An object (\code{\linkS4class{Method}}) for specifying targets.

\description{
Specify targets based on the methodology outlined by
Rodrigues \emph{et al.} (2004).
Briefly, this method involves setting targets based on log-linear
interpolation methods.
To help prevent widespread features from obscuring priorities,
targets are capped following Butchart \emph{et al.} (2015).
This method was designed for global-scale prioritizations.
Note that this function is designed to be used within \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}.
}
\details{
This target setting method was designed to protect species in global-scale
prioritizations (Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2004).
Although it has also been successfully applied to global-scales
(e.g., Butchart \emph{et al.} 2015; Hanson \emph{et al.} 2020; Venter \emph{et al.} 2014),
it may fail to identify meaningful priorities for
prioritizations conducted at smaller geographic scales
(e.g., national, state-level or county scales).
For example, if this method is applied to
such geographic scales, then the resulting prioritizations
may select an overly large percentage of the study area,
or be biased towards over-representing common and widespread species.
This is because the thresholds
(i.e., \code{rare_threshold}, \code{common_threshold}, and \code{cap_threshold})
were originally developed based on criteria for promoting the long-term
persistence of entire species.
As such, if you are working at a sub-global scale, it is recommended to set
thresholds based on that criteria are appropriate to the spatial extent
of the planning region.
Please note that this function is provided as convenient method to
set targets for problems with a single management zone, and cannot
be used for those with multiple management zones.
}
\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method involves setting target thresholds based on the spatial
extent of the features.
By default, this method identifies rare features as those with a
spatial distribution smaller than 1,000
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} (per \code{rare_threshold})
and common features as those with a spatial distribution
larger than 250,000
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} (per \code{common_threshold}).
Given this, rare features are assigned a target threshold
of 100\% (per \code{rare_relative_target}), common features
are assigned a target threshold of 10\% (per \code{common_relative_target}),
and features with a spatial distribution that is between
the area-based thresholds used to identify rare and common features are
assigned a target threshold through log-linear interpolation.
Additionally, following Butchart \emph{et al.} (2015), a cap of 1,000,000
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} is applied to target
thresholds.
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
As such, this function may need to make particular assumptions depending
on the data used to specify the planning units and features in \code{x}.
If possible, when building \code{x} with \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}, it is recommended to specify
\code{features} as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object to ensure correctness.
Although this function can be used to specify targets for features
in other data formats, you must take care to ensure that the information
specifying the amount of each feature are in units of 1 km
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
To help ensure that you are aware of this limitation, this function will
produce a warning to alert you when the features in \code{x} belong to such
data formats.
If you are confident that your data are in the correct units,
then you can safely ignore this warning.
Below we provide details for ensuring that the targets are calculated
correctly.

\describe{
\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} planning units and \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} features}{
This function will automatically ensure that the targets are calculated
correctly. Given this, it is recommended to specify \code{features} in either
of these when building a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{character} features}{
Here, the argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify
which columns of the planning unit data denote the amount of each feature
present within each planning unit.
All of these columns must contain values in
units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
For example, if \code{features = c("spp1", "spp2", "spp3")}, then the columns
\code{"spp1"}, \code{"spp2"}, and \code{"spp3"} of the planning unit denote data the amount
of the first, second, and third features (respectively) present within each
planning unit. If the column \code{"spp1"} has a value of 5 in the first row
of the planning unit data, then this means the first planning unit
contains 5 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}
of habitat for the feature \code{"spp1"}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij} must contain a \code{data.frame}
with the columns \code{"pu"}, \code{"species"}, \code{"amount"}. For a given row,
the \code{"pu"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the identifier
for the planning unit,
the \code{"species"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the
identifier for the feature,
and \verb{"amount" contains a }numeric\verb{value denoting the amount of the the feature (per the}"species"\verb{column) that is present in the planning unit (per}"pu"\verb{column). Given this, the "amount" column must contain values that in units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}. For example, if the argument to}rij\verb{has a row where the}"pu"\verb{column has a value of 1, the}"species"\verb{column has a value of 2, and the}"amount"` column has a value of 3: then this means that the
planning unit with an identifier of 1 contains 3
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of the feature
associated with the identifier of 2.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{numeric} or \code{matrix} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij_matrix} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij_matrix} must contain a \code{matrix}
(or \code{list} of \code{matrix} objects) that contains \code{numeric} values in units of 1
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
