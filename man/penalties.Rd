\title{Add a penalty}
\description{
A penalty can be applied to a conservation planning problem to
penalize solutions according to a specific metric. They
directly trade-off with the primary objective of a problem
(e.g., the primary objective when using \code{\link[=add_min_set_objective]{add_min_set_objective()}} is
to minimize solution cost). If you want to generate a prioritization that
only focuses on minimizing a particular penalty, then the minimum
penalties objective should be used (i.e., \code{\link[=add_min_penalties_objective]{add_min_penalties_objective()}}).
}
\details{
Both penalties and constraints can be used to modify a problem and
identify solutions that exhibit specific characteristics. Constraints work
by adding rules to ensure that solutions exhibit (or do not exhibit) a
particular characteristic.
On the other hand, penalties work by specifying trade-offs against the
primary problem objective and are mediated by a penalty factor.
Note that although multiple penalty functions can be added to a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}},
this will likely increase solver run time.

The following functions can be used to add a penalty to a
conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=add_boundary_penalties]{add_boundary_penalties()}}}{
Add penalties to a
conservation problem to favor solutions that have
planning units clumped together into contiguous areas.
}

\item{\code{\link[=add_neighbor_penalties]{add_neighbor_penalties()}}}{
Add penalties to a
conservation problem to favor solutions that have
a large number of planning units sited next to each other.
This constraints may be especially useful for
reducing spatial fragmentation in large-scale planning problems or
when using open source solvers.
}

\item{\code{\link[=add_asym_connectivity_penalties]{add_asym_connectivity_penalties()}}}{
Add penalties to a conservation problem to account for
asymmetric connectivity.
}

\item{\code{\link[=add_connectivity_penalties]{add_connectivity_penalties()}}}{
Add penalties to a conservation problem to account for
symmetric connectivity.
}

\item{\code{\link[=add_linear_penalties]{add_linear_penalties()}}}{
Add penalties to a conservation problem to favor solutions that avoid
selecting planning units based on a certain variable
(e.g., anthropogenic pressure).
}
