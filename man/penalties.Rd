\title{Conservation problem penalties}
\description{
A penalty can be applied to a conservation planning \code{\link{problem}} to
penalize solutions according to a specific metric. Penalties---unlike
\code{\link{constraints}}---act as an explicit trade-off with the objective
being minimized or maximized (e.g. solution cost when used with
\code{\link{add_min_set_objective}}).
}
\details{
Both penalties and constraints can be used to modify a problem and
identify solutions that exhibit specific characteristics. Constraints work
by invalidating solutions that do not exhibit specific characteristics.
On the other hand, penalties work by specifying trade-offs against the
main problem objective and are mediated by a penalty factor. Below are the
penalties that can be added to a \code{ConservationProblem} object.

\describe{

\item{\code{\link{add_boundary_penalties}}}{Add penalties to a
  conservation problem to favor solutions that have
  planning units clumped together into contiguous areas.}

\item{\code{\link{add_connectivity_penalties}}}{Add penalties to a
  conservation problem to favor solutions that select
  planning units with high connectivity between them.}

}

\examples{
## load data
data(sim_pu_points, sim_features)

## create basic problem
p1 <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
      add_min_set_objective() \%>\%
      add_relative_targets(0.2) \%>\%
      add_default_solver()

## create problem with boundary penalties
p2 <- p1 \%>\% add_boundary_penalties(5, 1)

## create problem with connectivity penalties
# create connectivity matrix based on spatial proximity
sc_matrix <- as.data.frame(sim_pu_raster, xy = TRUE, na.rm = FALSE)
sc_matrix <- 1 / (as.matrix(dist(sc_matrix)) + 1)

# remove weak and moderate connections between planning units to reduce
# run-time
sc_matrix[sc_matrix < 0.85] <- 0

# create problem
p3 <- p1 \%>\% add_connectivity_penalties(25, sc_matrix)
\donttest{
## solve problems
s <- stack(solve(p1), solve(p2), solve(p3))

# plot solutions
plot(s, axes = FALSE, box = FALSE,
     main = c("basic solution", "boundary penalties",
              "connectivity penalties"))
