\title{Add a penalty}
\description{
A penalty can be applied to a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} to
penalize solutions according to a specific metric. They
directly trade-off with the primary objective of a problem
(e.g., the primary objective when using \code{\link[=add_min_set_objective]{add_min_set_objective()}} is
to minimize solution cost).
}
\details{
Both penalties and constraints can be used to modify a problem and
identify solutions that exhibit specific characteristics. Constraints work
by invalidating solutions that do not exhibit specific characteristics.
On the other hand, penalties work by specifying trade-offs against the
primary problem objective and are mediated by a penalty factor.

The following penalties can be added to a conservation planning
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}:

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=add_boundary_penalties]{add_boundary_penalties()}}}{Add penalties to a
conservation problem to favor solutions that have
planning units clumped together into contiguous areas.}

\item{\code{\link[=add_asym_connectivity_penalties]{add_asym_connectivity_penalties()}}}{Add penalties to a
conservation problem to account for asymmetric connectivity.}

\item{\code{\link[=add_connectivity_penalties]{add_connectivity_penalties()}}}{Add penalties to a
conservation problem to account for
symmetric connectivity.}

\item{\code{\link[=add_linear_penalties]{add_linear_penalties()}}}{Add penalties to a
conservation problem to favor solutions that avoid selecting
planning units based on a certain variable
(e.g., anthropogenic pressure).}
