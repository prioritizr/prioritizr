\title{Add a \emph{CPLEX} solver}
\usage{
add_cplex_solver(
  x,
  gap = 0.1,
  time_limit = .Machine$integer.max,
  presolve = TRUE,
  threads = 1,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} (i.e. \code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}}) object.}

\item{gap}{\code{numeric} gap to optimality. This gap is relative
and expresses the acceptable deviance from the optimal objective.
For example, a value of 0.01 will result in the solver stopping when
it has found a solution within 1\% of optimality.
Additionally, a value of 0 will result in the solver stopping
when it has found an optimal solution.
The default value is 0.1 (i.e. 10\% from optimality).}

\item{time_limit}{\code{numeric} time limit (seconds) for generating solutions.
The solver will return the current best solution when this time limit is
exceeded. The default value is the largest integer value
(i.e. \code{.Machine$integer.max}), effectively meaning that solver
will keep running until a solution within the optimality gap is found.}

\item{presolve}{\code{logical} attempt to simplify the
problem before solving it? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{threads}{\code{integer} number of threads to use for the
optimization algorithm. The default value is 1.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} should information be printed while solving
optimization problems? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Object (i.e. \code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}}) with the solver
added to it.
}
\description{
Specify that the
\href{https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer}{\emph{IBM CPLEX}} software
(IBM 2017) should be used to solve a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
This function can also be used to customize the behavior of the solver.
It requires the \pkg{cplexAPI} package to be installed
(see below for installation instructions).
}
\details{
\href{https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer}{\emph{IBM CPLEX}} is a
commercial optimization software. It is faster than
the available open source solvers (e.g. \code{\link[=add_lpsymphony_solver]{add_lpsymphony_solver()}} and
\code{\link[=add_rsymphony_solver]{add_rsymphony_solver()}}.
Although formal benchmarks examining the performance of this solver for
conservation planning problems have yet to be completed, preliminary
analyses suggest that it performs slightly slower than the \emph{Gurobi}
solver (i.e. \code{\link[=add_gurobi_solver]{add_gurobi_solver()}}).
We recommend using this solver if the \emph{Gurobi} solver is not available.
Licenses are available for the \emph{IBM CPLEX} software to academics at no cost
(see \url{https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio}).
}
\section{Installation}{

The pkg{cplexAPI} package is used to interface with \emph{IBM CPLEX}. To install
this package, the \code{CPLEX_BIN} variable must be set (similar to
the \code{GUROBI_HOME} variable for the \emph{Gurobi} software) to specify
the file path for the \emph{CPLEX} software. For example, on a Linux system,
this variable can be specified by adding the following text to the
\verb{~/.bashrc} file:\preformatted{  export CPLEX_BIN="/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio128/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/cplex"
}

Note that you may need to change the version
number in the file path (i.e. \code{"CPLEX_Studio128"}). For more information
on installing the pkg{cplexAPI} package, please see the
\href{https://github.com/cran/cplexAPI/blob/master/inst/INSTALL}{official installation instructions for the package}.
