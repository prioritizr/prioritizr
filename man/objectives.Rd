\title{Problem objective}
\description{
A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the problem.
All conservation planning problems involve minimizing or maximizing some
kind of objective. For instance, the planner may require a solution that
conserves enough habitat for each species while minimizing the overall cost
of the reserve network. Alternatively, the planner may require a solution
that maximizes the number of conserved species while ensuring that the cost
of the reserve network does not exceed the budget.

While some users may feel that explicitly defining an objective for a
conservation problem adds some element of arbitrariness or subjectivity to
the decision making process, we remind them that "canned" decision support
tools (such as Marxan or Zonation) also have objectives. The key difference
here is that instead of choosing between different software programs here
the user is explicitly choosing their objective within the single
environment.

\strong{Please note that failing to specify an objective will return a
default error message when solving.}

\details{
The following objectives can be added to a conservation planning
\code{\link{problem}}:

\describe{

  \item{\code{\link{add_min_set_objective}}}{Set an objective to find the
  solution that fulfills all the targets and constraints for the smallest
  cost. This objective is similar to that used in Marxan.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_max_cover_objective}}}{Set an objective to find the
  solution that secures as much of each feature as possible without
  exceeding the budget.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_max_features_objective}}}{Set an objective to find
  to find the solution that fulfills as many targets as possible while
  ensuring that the cost of the solution does not exceed budget and that all
  constraints are met.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_max_phylo_objective}}}{Set an objective to find the
  solution that fulfills as much of a representative sample a phylogenetic
  tree as possible given a budget. This objective is similar
  to \code{add_max_features_objective} except that emphasis is placed
  on phylogenetic representation rather than target representation. This
  objective requires the "ape" R package to be installed.}

\examples{
# load data
data(sim_pu_raster, sim_features, sim_phylogeny)

# create base problem
p <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
     add_relative_targets(0.1)

 # create problem with added minimum set objective
p1 <- p \%>\% add_min_set_objective()

# create problem with added maximum coverage objective
# note that this objective does not use targets
p2 <- p \%>\% add_max_cover_objective(5000)

# create problem with added maximum feature representation objective
p3 <- p \%>\% add_max_features_objective(5000)

# create problem with added maximum phylogenetic representation objective
p4 <- p \%>\% add_max_phylo_objective(5000, sim_phylogeny)
\donttest{
# solve problems
s <- stack(solve(p1), solve(p2), solve(p3), solve(p4))

# plot solutions
plot(s, main = c("minimum set", "maximum coverage", "maximum representation",
                 "phylogenetic representation"), axes = FALSE, box = FALSE)
