\usage{
feature_abundances(x, na.rm)

\method{feature_abundances}{ConservationProblem}(x, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} (i.e. \code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}}) object.}

\item{na.rm}{\code{logical} should planning units with \code{NA} cost
data be excluded from the abundance calculations? The default argument
is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} object containing the total amount
(\code{"absolute_abundance"}) and proportion (\code{"relative_abundance"})
of the distribution of each feature in the planning units. Here, each
row contains data that pertain to a specific feature in a specific
management zone (if multiple zones are present). This object
contains the following columns:

\describe{

\item{feature}{\code{character} name of the feature.}

\item{zone}{\code{character} name of the zone (not included when the
argument to \code{x} contains only one management zone).}

\item{absolute_abundance}{\code{numeric} amount of each feature in the
planning units. If the problem contains multiple zones, then this
column shows how well each feature is represented in a each
zone.}

\item{relative_abundance}{\code{numeric} proportion of the feature's
distribution in the planning units. If the argument to \code{na.rm} is
\code{FALSE}, then this column will only contain values equal to one.
Otherwise, if the argument to \code{na.rm} is \code{TRUE} and planning
units with \code{NA} cost data contain non-zero amounts of each feature,
then this column will contain values between zero and one.}

}
}
\description{
Calculate the total abundance of each feature found in the planning units
of a conservation planning problem.
}
\details{
Planning units can have cost data with finite values
(e.g. 0.1, 3, 100) and \code{NA} values. This functionality is provided so
that locations which are not available for protected area acquisition can
be included when calculating targets for conservation features
(e.g. when targets are specified using \code{\link[=add_relative_targets]{add_relative_targets()}}).
If the total amount of each feature in all the planning units is
required---including the planning units with \code{NA} cost data---then the
the \code{na.rm} argument should be set to \code{FALSE}. However, if
the planning units with \code{NA} cost data should be
excluded---for instance, to calculate the highest feasible targets for
each feature---then the \code{na.rm} argument should be set to
\code{TRUE}.
