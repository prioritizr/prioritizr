\title{Specify targets following a set of rules}
\usage{
spec_rule_targets(
  baseline_relative_target,
  rules_relative_target,
  data,
  cap_area_target = 1e+06,
  area_units = "km^2"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseline_relative_target}{\code{numeric} value indicating the baseline
target values as a proportion (ranging between 0 and 1). Depending on
context of the prioritization exercise, a value of 0.3 (i.e., 30\%)
may be appropriate (Harris \emph{et al.} 2023).}

\item{rules_relative_target}{named \code{numeric} vector with name-value key pairs
denoting the values that should be added together when calculating the
relative target for a given feature. Note that values must range
between -1 and 1, and the names must correspond to column names of \code{data}.}

\item{data}{\code{data.frame} indicating if each feature meets the criteria
for applying each rule (or not) during the target calculations.
Here, each row must correspond to a different feature, and each column
contains information about the feature (per \code{feature_names(x)}).
In particular, \code{data}
must have a \code{"feature"} column that contains \code{character} values with the
feature names. Additionally, \code{data} must also contain columns
with \code{logical} (\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}) values that indicate if the feature
meets a particular criterion for calculating targets.
For example,
\code{data} could contain columns that indicate if each feature corresponds
to a threatened species, ecosystem service, or culturally important site.
Note that if different rules should be applied to species based on their
particular threat status (e.g., Critically Endangered and Vulnerable species
should receive different target thresholds), then \code{data} should contain a
column for each threat status (separately).}

\item{cap_area_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the area-based target cap.
To avoid setting a target cap, a missing (\code{NA}) value can be specified.
Defaults to 1000000
(i.e., 1,000,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{area_units}{\code{character} value denoting the unit of measurement
for the area-based arguments.
Defaults to \code{"km^2"}
(i.e., \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}
}
\value{
An object (\code{\linkS4class{TargetMethod}}) for specifying targets that
can be used with \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}} and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}
to update the targets for a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}
\description{
Specify targets based on a set of rules for ecological and ecosystem
criteria. This is a customizable version of the
approach in Harris and Holness (2023).
To help prevent widespread features from obscuring priorities,
targets are capped following Butchart \emph{et al.} (2015).
This method was designed to help set targets for a broad range of features
(e.g., species, ecosystems, ecosystem services, ecological processes)
at local and national scales.
Note that this function is designed to be used with \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}.
}
\details{
This method has been applied to set target thresholds at national
scales (e.g., Harris \emph{et al.} 2023).
It is based on the rationale that it is appropriate to set the target
for a feature based on a linear combination of values.
When using this method in a planning exercise, it is important to ensure
that the criteria and values used to parameterize the rules
reflect the stakeholder objectives.
Additionally, the baseline relative target (per \code{baseline_relative_target})
and cap threshold (per \code{cap_area_target} and \code{area_units}) may need to
set based on the features and spatial extent of the planning region.
Please note that this function is provided as convenient method to
set targets for problems with a single management zone, and cannot
be used for those with multiple management zones.

\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method provides a flexible approach for setting target thresholds based
on a set of rules.
To express this mathematically, we will define the following terminology.
Let \eqn{f} denote the total abundance of a feature (e.g., geographic
range), \eqn{b} denote the baseline relative target threshold
(per \code{baseline_relative_target}), and let \eqn{c} denote the cap threshold
(per \code{cap_area_target} and \code{area_units}).
To describe the rules, let \eqn{U} denote the set of rules
(indexed by \eqn{u}), \eqn{d_u}{du} indicate if the target for
the feature should be calculated based on each rule \eqn{u \in U}{u in U}
(using binary values, per \code{data}), and \eqn{a_u} denote the value
that should be added to the target given each rule \eqn{u \in U}{u in U}
(per \code{rules_relative_target}).
Given this terminology, the target threshold (\eqn{t}) for the feature
is calculated as follows.
\deqn{
t = min(f \times max(min(b + \sum_{u \in U} d_u \times a_u, 1), 0), c)
}{
t = min(f * max(min(b + sum_u^U d_u * a_u, 1), 0), c)
}
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
Although it can be readily applied to \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects that
have the feature data provided as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object,
you will need to specify the spatial units for the features
when initializing the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} objects if the feature data
are provided in a different format. In particular, if the feature
data are provided as a \code{data.frame} or \code{character} vector,
then you will need to specify an argument to \code{feature_units} when
using the \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} function.
See the Examples section of the documentation for \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
for a demonstration of specifying the spatial units for features.
