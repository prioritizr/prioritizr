\usage{
compile(x, ...)

\method{compile}{ConservationProblem}(x, compressed_formulation = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.}

\item{...}{not used.}

\item{compressed_formulation}{\code{logical} should the conservation problem
compiled into a compressed version of a planning problem?
If \code{TRUE} then the problem is expressed using the compressed
formulation. If \code{FALSE} then the problem is expressed using the
expanded formulation. If \code{NA}, then the compressed is used unless one
of the constraints requires the expanded formulation. This argument
defaults to \code{NA}.}

\value{
\code{\link{OptimizationProblem-class}} object.
}
\description{
Compile a conservation planning \code{\link{problem}} into an
(potentially mixed) integer linear programming problem.
}
\details{
This function might be useful for those interested in understanding
  how their conservation planning \code{\link{problem}} is expressed
  as a mathematical problem. However, if the problem just needs to
  be solved, then the \code{\link{solve}} function should just be used.

  \strong{Please note that in nearly all cases, the default argument to
  \code{formulation} should be used}. The only situation where manually
  setting the argument to \code{formulation} is desirable is during testing.
  Manually setting the argument to \code{formulation} will at best
  have no effect on the problem. At worst, it may result in
  an error, a misspecified problem, or unnecessarily long
  solve times.
