\description{
Calculate importance scores for planning units selected in a solution
based on the replacement cost method (Cabeza and Moilanen 2006).
}
\details{
This function implements a modified version of the
replacement cost method (Cabeza and Moilanen 2006).
Specifically, the score for each planning unit is calculated
as the difference in the objective value of a solution when each planning
unit is locked out and the optimization processes rerun with all other
selected planning units locked in. In other words, the replacement cost
metric corresponds to change in solution quality incurred if a given
planning unit cannot be acquired when implementing the solution and the
next best planning unit (or set of planning units) will need to be
considered instead. Thus planning units with a higher score are more
important (and irreplaceable).
For example, when using the minimum set objective function
(\code{\link[=add_min_set_objective]{add_min_set_objective()}}), the replacement cost scores
correspond to the additional costs needed to meet targets when each
planning unit is locked out. When using the maximum utility
objective function (\code{\link[=add_max_utility_objective]{add_max_utility_objective()}}, the
replacement cost scores correspond to the reduction in the utility when
each planning unit is locked out. Infinite values mean that no feasible
solution exists when planning units are locked out---they are
absolutely essential for obtaining a solution (e.g. they contain rare
species that are not found in any other planning units or were locked in).
Zeros values mean that planning units can swapped with other planning units
and this will have no effect on the performance of the solution at all
(e.g. because they were only selected due to spatial fragmentation
penalties).

These calculations can take a long time to complete for large
or complex conservation planning problems. As such, we using this
method for small or moderate-sized conservation planning problems
(e.g. < 30,000 planning units). To reduce run time, we
recommend calculating these scores without additional penalties (e.g.
\code{\link[=add_boundary_penalties]{add_boundary_penalties()}}) or spatial constraints (e.g.
\code{\link[=add_contiguity_constraints]{add_contiguity_constraints()}}). To further reduce run time,
we recommend using proportion-type decisions when calculating the scores
(see below for an example).

\section{Solution format}{

Broadly speaking, the argument to \code{solution} must be in the same format as
the planning unit data in the argument to \code{x}.
Further details on the correct format are listed separately
for each of the different planning unit data formats:

\describe{

\item{\code{x} has \code{numeric} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution} must be a
\code{numeric} vector with each element corresponding to a different planning
unit. It should have the same number of planning units as those
in the argument to \code{x}. Additionally, any planning units missing
cost (\code{NA}) values should also have missing (\code{NA}) values in the
argument to \code{solution}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{matrix} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution} must be a
\code{matrix} vector with each row corresponding to a different planning
unit, and each column correspond to a different management zone.
It should have the same number of planning units and zones
as those in the argument to \code{x}. Additionally, any planning units
missing cost (\code{NA}) values for a particular zone should also have a
missing (\code{NA}) values in the argument to \code{solution}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\linkS4class{Raster}} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution}
be a \code{\linkS4class{Raster}} object where different grid cells (pixels) correspond
to different planning units and layers correspond to
a different management zones. It should have the same dimensionality
(rows, columns, layers), resolution, extent, and coordinate reference
system as the planning units in the argument to \code{x}. Additionally,
any planning units missing cost (\code{NA}) values for a particular zone
should also have missing (\code{NA})  values in the argument to \code{solution}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{data.frame} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution} must
be a \code{data.frame} with each column corresponding to a different zone,
each row corresponding to a different planning unit, and cell values
corresponding to the solution value. This means that if a \code{data.frame}
object containing the solution also contains additional columns, then
these columns will need to be subsetted prior to using this function
(see below for example with \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} data).
Additionally, any planning units missing cost
(\code{NA}) values for a particular zone should also have missing (\code{NA})
values in the argument to \code{solution}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\linkS4class{Spatial}} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution}
must be a \code{\linkS4class{Spatial}} object with each column corresponding to a
different zone, each row corresponding to a different planning unit, and
cell values corresponding to the solution value. This means that if the
\code{\linkS4class{Spatial}} object containing the solution also contains additional
columns, then these columns will need to be subsetted prior to using this
function (see below for example with \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} data).
Additionally, the argument to \code{solution} must also have the same
coordinate reference system as the planning unit data.
Furthermore, any planning units missing cost
(\code{NA}) values for a particular zone should also have missing (\code{NA})
values in the argument to \code{solution}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} planning units}{The argument to \code{solution} must be
a \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} object with each column corresponding to a different
zone, each row corresponding to a different planning unit, and cell values
corresponding to the solution value. This means that if the
\code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} object containing the solution also contains additional
columns, then these columns will need to be subsetted prior to using this
function (see below for example).
Additionally, the argument to \code{solution} must also have the same
coordinate reference system as the planning unit data.
Furthermore, any planning units missing cost
(\code{NA}) values for a particular zone should also have missing (\code{NA})
values in the argument to \code{solution}.
