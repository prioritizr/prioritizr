\title{Write problem}
\usage{
write_problem(x, path, solver = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object.}

\item{path}{\code{character} file path to save the problem formulation.
The argument should contain a \code{".lp"} or \verb{.mps"} file extension
to specify whether the problem formulation will be saved in the
\href{https://docs.gurobi.com/current/#refman/lp_format.html}{LP} or
\href{https://docs.gurobi.com/current/#refman/mps_format.html}{MPS}
format (respectively). If using the Gurobi solver
(i.e., \code{solver = "gurobi"}), the problem can
be saved in a compressed file format (e.g., \code{".mps.gx"}) to reduce
file size (see \code{?gurobi::gurobi_write()} for details).}

\item{solver}{\code{character} name of optimization solver to write the problem
to disk. Available options include: \code{"rsymphony" }, \code{"gurobi"}, or \code{NULL}.
Note that using the Gurobi solver is much faster, because the Rsymphony
solver requires attempting to solve the problem before it can be written.
Defaults to \code{NULL}, such that the best available solver is used.}
}
\value{
An invisible \code{TRUE} indicating success.
}
\description{
Save the mathematical formulation for a conservation planning problem
to a file for mixed integer programming solvers. Note that this function
requires either the \pkg{Rsymphony} or \pkg{gurobi} package to be installed.

# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(500)

# load data
