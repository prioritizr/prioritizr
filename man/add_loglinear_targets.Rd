\arguments{

\description{
Set targets by log-linearly interpolating them between thresholds
(Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2004).
Additionally, caps can be applied to targets to prevent features with
massive distributions from being over-represented in solutions
(Butchart \emph{et al.} 2015). \strong{The behavior of this function has
changed substantially from versions prior to 5.0.0}.
}
\details{
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a feature's
distribution that needs to be protected. All conservation planning problems
require adding targets with the exception of the maximum cover problem
(see \code{\link{add_max_cover_objective}}), which maximizes all features
in the solution and therefore does not require targets.

Six parameters are used to calculate the targets: \code{lower_bound_amount}
specifies the first range size threshold, \code{lower_bound_target} specifies
the relative target required for species with a range size equal to or less
than the first threshold, \code{upper_bound_amount} specifies the second
range size threshold, \code{upper_bound_target} specifies
the relative target required for species with a range size equal to or
greater than the second threshold, \code{cap_amount} specifies the third
range size threshold, and \code{cap_target} specifies the absolute
target that is uniformly applied to species with a range size larger than
that third threshold.

Note that the target calculations do \strong{not} account for the
size of each planning unit. Therefore, the feature data should account for
the size of each planning unit if this is important (e.g. Pixel values in
the argument to \code{features} in the function \code{\link{problem}} could
correspond to amount of land occupied by the feature (\deqn{km^2})).

This function can only be applied to \code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}}
objects that are associated with a single zone.
