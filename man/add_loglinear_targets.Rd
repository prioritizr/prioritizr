\description{
Add targets to a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} by log-linearly
interpolating the targets between thresholds based on the total amount of
each feature in the study area (Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2004). Additionally,
caps can be applied to targets to prevent features with massive
distributions from being over-represented
in solutions (Butchart \emph{et al.} 2015).
}
\details{
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a
feature's distribution that needs to be protected. All conservation
planning problems require adding targets with the exception of the maximum
cover problem (see \code{\link[=add_max_cover_objective]{add_max_cover_objective()}}), which maximizes
all features in the solution and therefore does not require targets.

Seven parameters are used to calculate the targets:
\code{lower_bound_amount} specifies the first range size threshold,
\code{lower_bound_target} specifies the relative target required for
species with a range size equal to or less than the first threshold,
\code{upper_bound_amount} specifies the second range size threshold,
\code{upper_bound_target} specifies the relative target required for
species with a range size equal to or greater than the second threshold,
\code{cap_amount} specifies the third range size threshold,
\code{cap_target} specifies the absolute target that is uniformly applied
to species with a range size larger than that third threshold, and finally
\code{abundances} specifies the range size for each feature
that should be used when calculating the targets.

The target calculations do not account for the
size of each planning unit. Therefore, the feature data should account for
the size of each planning unit if this is important (e.g. pixel values in
the argument to \code{features} in the function \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} could
correspond to amount of land occupied by the feature in \eqn{km^2} units).
Additionally, the function can only be applied to
\code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}} objects that are associated with a
single zone.

\section{Notes}{

Early versions (< 5.0.2.4) used different equations for calculating
targets.
