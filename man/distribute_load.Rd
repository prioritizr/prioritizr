\usage{
distribute_load(x, n = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{integer} number of item to process.}

\item{n}{\code{integer} number of threads.}
}
\value{
\code{list} object.
}
\description{
Utility function for distributing computations among a pool of workers
for parallel processing.
}
\details{
This function returns a \code{list} containing an element for
each worker. Each element contains a \code{integer} \code{vector}
specifying the indices that the worker should process.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

# imagine that we have 10 jobs that need processing. For simplicity,
# our jobs will involve adding 1 to each element in 1:10.
values <- 1:10

# we could complete this processing using the following vectorized code
result <- 1 + 1:10
print(result)

# however, if our jobs were complex then we would be better off using
# functionals
result <- lapply(1:10, function(x) x + 1)
print(result)

# we could do one better, and use the "plyr" package to handle the
# processing
result <- plyr::llply(1:10, function(x) x + 1)
print(result)

# we could also use the parallel processing options available through "plyr"
# to use more computation resources to complete the jobs (note that since
# these jobs are very quick to process this is actually slower).
cl <- parallel::makeCluster(2, "PSOCK")
doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl)
result <- plyr::llply(1:10, function(x) x + 1, .parallel = TRUE)
cl <- parallel::stopCluster(cl)
print(result)

# however this approach iterates over each element individually, we could
# use the distribute_load function to split the N jobs up into K super
# jobs, and evaluate each super job using vectorized code.
x <- 1:10
cl <- parallel::makeCluster(2, "PSOCK")
parallel::clusterExport(cl, 'x', envir = environment())
doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl)
l <- distribute_load(length(x), n = 2)
result <- plyr::llply(l, function(i) x[i] + 1, .parallel = TRUE)
cl <- parallel::stopCluster(cl)
print(result)
