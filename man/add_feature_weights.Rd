\description{
Add features weights to a conservation planning problem. Specifically,
some objective functions aim to maximize (or minimize) a metric that
measures how well a set of features are represented by a solution
(e.g., maximize the number of features that are adequately represented,
\code{\link[=add_max_features_objective]{add_max_features_objective()}}). In such cases,
it may be desirable to prefer the representation of some features
over other features (e.g., features that have higher extinction risk
might be considered more important than those with lower extinction risk).
To achieve this, weights can be used to specify how much more important
it is for a solution to represent particular features compared with other
features.
}
\details{
Weights can only be applied to problems that have an objective
that is budget limited (e.g., \code{\link[=add_max_cover_objective]{add_max_cover_objective()}},
\code{\link[=add_min_shortfall_objective]{add_min_shortfall_objective()}}).
They can also be applied to problems that aim to maximize phylogenetic
representation (\code{\link[=add_max_phylo_div_objective]{add_max_phylo_div_objective()}}) to favor the
representation of specific features over the representation of
some phylogenetic branches. Weights cannot be negative values
and must have values that are equal to or larger than zero.
\strong{Note that planning unit costs are scaled to 0.01 to identify
the cheapest solution among multiple optimal solutions. This means
that the optimization process will favor cheaper solutions over solutions
that meet feature targets (or occurrences) when feature weights are
lower than 0.01.}
}
\section{Weights format}{


The argument to \code{weights} can be specified using the following formats.

\describe{

\item{\code{weights} as a \code{numeric} vector}{containing weights for each feature.
Note that this format cannot be used to specify weights for problems with
multiple zones.}

\item{\code{weights} as a \code{matrix} object}{containing weights
for each feature in each zone.
Here, each row corresponds to a different feature in argument to
\code{x}, each column corresponds to a different zone in argument to
\code{x}, and each cell contains the weight value for a given feature
that the solution can to secure in a given zone. Note that
if the problem contains targets created using
\code{\link[=add_manual_targets]{add_manual_targets()}} then a \code{matrix} should be
supplied containing a single column that indicates that weight for
fulfilling each target.}
