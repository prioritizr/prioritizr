\title{Add feature weights}
\usage{
add_feature_weights(x, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.}

\item{weights}{\code{numeric} weights. Features with higher weights indicate
that it is more desirable to represent them in the solution. Weights
cannot have negative values.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object with the weights
  added to it.
}
\description{
Conservation planning problems that aim to maximize the representation of
enough. In such budget-limited problems, it may be desirable to prefer the
representation of some features over others. Weights can be be applied to
a problem to favor the representation of some features over others when
making decisions about how the budget should be allocated.
}
\details{
Weights can only be applied to a budget-limited
  type of planning problem (ie. \code{\link{add_max_cover_objective}},
  and \code{\link{add_max_features_objective}}. Weights can also
  be applied to problems that aim to maximize phylogenetic representation
  (\code{\link{add_max_phylo_objective}}) to favor the
  representation of specific features over the representation of
  some phylogenetic branches.
}
\examples{
# create problem
p1 <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
  add_max_cover_objective(budget=5000)

# create weights based on rarity (1/number occurrences)
w <- 1 / cellStats(sim_features, "sum") * 1000

# create new problem with added weights according to rarity
p2 <- p1 \%>\% add_feature_weights(w)

\donttest{
# solve solutions
s <- stack(solve(p1), solve(p2))

# plot solutions
plot(s, main = c("equal weights", "rarity weights"))
}
