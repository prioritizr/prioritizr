\arguments{
\item{pop_size_targets}{\code{numeric} vector that specifies the minimum
population size for each feature.
If a single \code{numeric} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets based on the same population size.}

\item{pop_density}{\code{numeric} vector that specifies the population density
for each feature. If a single \code{numeric} value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming the same population density factor.
See Population density section for more details.}

\item{density_units}{\code{character} vector that specifies the area-based units
for the population density values. For example, units can be used to
express that population densities are in terms of individuals per hectare
(\verb{"ha"), acre (}"acre"\verb{), or \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} (}km^2\verb{). If a single }character` value is specified, then all
features are assigned targets assuming that population density values
are in the same units.
See Population density section for more details.}

\item{cap_area_target}{\code{numeric} value denoting the area-based target cap.
To avoid setting a target cap, a missing (\code{NA}) value can be specified.
Defaults to 1000000
(i.e., 1,000,000 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}).}

\item{area_units}{\code{character} value denoting the unit of measurement
for the area-based arguments.
Defaults to \code{"km^2"}

\description{
Specify targets based on the minimum number of individuals for each
feature.
Briefly, this target setting method involves using population density
data to set a target threshold for the minimum amount of habitat required
to safeguard a pre-specified number of individuals.
To help prevent widespread features from obscuring priorities,
targets are capped following Butchart \emph{et al.} (2015).
Note that this function is designed to be used within \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}.
}
\details{
This target setting method can be used to set targets for a species based on
a population size threshold.
Many different population size thresholds -- and methods for calculating
such thresholds -- have been proposed for guiding conservation decisions
(Di Marco \emph{et al.} 2016).
For example, previous work has suggested that the number of
individuals for a population should not fall short of 50 individuals to avoid
inbreeding depression, and 500 individuals to reduce genetic drift
(reviewed by Jamieson and Allendorf 2012). Additionally, the
Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature has criteria related to population size,
where a species with fewer than 250, 2,500, or 10,000 individuals are
recognized as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable
(respectively) (IUCN 2025).
Alternatively, the SAFE index (Clements \emph{et al.} 2011) considers species
with fewer than 5,000
individuals to be threatened by extinction
(based on minimum population sizes reported by Brook \emph{et al.} 2006;
Traill \emph{et al.} 2007, 2010).
}
\section{Population density}{

Population density data are expressed as number of individuals per
unit area. For example, if a species has 200 individuals per hectare,
then this can be specified with \code{pop_density = 200} and
\code{density_units = "ha"}.
Alternatively, if a species has a population density where one individual
occurs every 10 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}, then
this can be specified with \code{pop_density = 0.1} and \code{density_units = "km^2"}.
Also, note that
population density is assumed to scale linearly with the values
in the feature data. For example, if a planning unit contains
5 \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of habitat for a feature,
\code{pop_density = 200}, and \code{density_units = "km^2"},
then the calculations assume that the planning unit contains 100 individuals
for the species.
Although the package does not provide the population density
data required to apply this target setting method, such data can be
obtained from published databases
(e.g., Santini \emph{et al.} 2022, 2023, 2024; Witting \emph{et al.} 2024).
}

\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method involves setting target thresholds based on the amount of habitat
required to safeguard a pre-specified number of individuals.
To express this mathematically, we will define the following terminology.
Let \eqn{f} denote the total abundance of a feature (i.e., geographic
range size expressed as \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}),
\eqn{n} denote the minimum number of individuals that should
ideally be represented (per \code{pop_size_targets}), and
\eqn{d} population density of the feature
(i.e.,
number of individuals per \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}},
per \code{pop_density} and \code{density_units}), and
\eqn{j} the target cap (expressed as
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}, per \code{cap_area_target}).
Given this terminology, the target threshold (\eqn{t}) for a feature
is calculated as follows.
\deqn{
t = min(f, min(j, min(n \times d))}{
t = min(f, min(j, n * d))
}
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
As such, this function may need to make particular assumptions depending
on the data used to specify the planning units and features in \code{x}.
If possible, when building \code{x} with \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}, it is recommended to specify
\code{features} as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object to ensure correctness.
Although this function can be used to specify targets for features
in other data formats, you must take care to ensure that the information
specifying the amount of each feature are in units of 1 km
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
To help ensure that you are aware of this limitation, this function will
produce a warning to alert you when the features in \code{x} belong to such
data formats.
If you are confident that your data are in the correct units,
then you can safely ignore this warning.
Below we provide details for ensuring that the targets are calculated
correctly.

\describe{
\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} planning units and \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} features}{
This function will automatically ensure that the targets are calculated
correctly. Given this, it is recommended to specify \code{features} in either
of these when building a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{character} features}{
Here, the argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify
which columns of the planning unit data denote the amount of each feature
present within each planning unit.
All of these columns must contain values in
units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
For example, if \code{features = c("spp1", "spp2", "spp3")}, then the columns
\code{"spp1"}, \code{"spp2"}, and \code{"spp3"} of the planning unit denote data the amount
of the first, second, and third features (respectively) present within each
planning unit. If the column \code{"spp1"} has a value of 5 in the first row
of the planning unit data, then this means the first planning unit
contains 5 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}
of habitat for the feature \code{"spp1"}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij} must contain a \code{data.frame}
with the columns \code{"pu"}, \code{"species"}, \code{"amount"}. For a given row,
the \code{"pu"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the identifier
for the planning unit,
the \code{"species"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the
identifier for the feature,
and \verb{"amount" contains a }numeric\verb{value denoting the amount of the the feature (per the}"species"\verb{column) that is present in the planning unit (per}"pu"\verb{column). Given this, the "amount" column must contain values that in units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}. For example, if the argument to}rij\verb{has a row where the}"pu"\verb{column has a value of 1, the}"species"\verb{column has a value of 2, and the}"amount"` column has a value of 3: then this means that the
planning unit with an identifier of 1 contains 3
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of the feature
associated with the identifier of 2.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{numeric} or \code{matrix} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij_matrix} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij_matrix} must contain a \code{matrix}
(or \code{list} of \code{matrix} objects) that contains \code{numeric} values in units of 1
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
