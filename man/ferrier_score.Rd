\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\linkS4class{ConservationProblem}} object.}

\item{solution}{\code{numeric}, \code{matrix}, \code{data.frame},
\code{\linkS4class{Raster}}, or \code{\linkS4class{Spatial}}
object. See the Details section for more information.}
}
\value{
A \code{matrix}, \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}},
\code{\linkS4class{RasterLayer}}, or
\code{\linkS4class{Spatial}} object containing the scores for each
planning unit selected in the solution.
}
\description{
Calculate irreplaceability scores for planning units selected in
a solution using the method outlined in Ferrier \emph{et al.} (2000).
Specifically, the scores are implemented following the CLUZ decision support
tool (Smith 2019).
Here, scores are calculated separately for each feature within
each planning unit. Additionally, a total irreplaceability score is also
calculated as the sum of the irreplaceability scores for each planning unit.
Note that this function only works for problems with
a minimum set objective and a single zone.
It will throw an error for other types of problems.
}
\details{
The argument to \code{solution} must correspond
to the planning unit data in the argument to \code{x} in terms
of data representation, dimensionality, and spatial attributes (if
applicable). This means that if the planning unit data in \code{x}
is a \code{numeric} vector then the argument to \code{solution} must be a
\code{numeric} vector with the same number of elements, if the planning
unit data in \code{x} is a \code{\linkS4class{RasterLayer}} then the
argument to \code{solution} must also be a
\code{\linkS4class{RasterLayer}} with the same number of rows and
columns and the same resolution, extent, and coordinate reference system,
if the planning unit data in \code{x} is a \code{\linkS4class{Spatial}}
object then the argument to \code{solution} must also be a
\code{\linkS4class{Spatial}} object and have the same number of spatial
features (e.g. polygons) and have the same coordinate reference system,
if the planning units in \code{x} are a \code{data.frame} then the
argument to \code{solution} must also be a \code{data.frame} with each
column correspond to a different zone and each row correspond to
a different planning unit, and values correspond to the allocations
(e.g. values of zero or one). Furthermore, solutions must have planning
unit statuses set to missing (\code{NA})
values for planning units that have missing (\code{NA}) cost data.
If an argument is supplied to
\code{solution} where this is not the case, then an error will be thrown.
