\arguments{

\value{
\code{\link[=ConservationProblem-class]{ConservationProblem-class()}} object with the constraints
added to it.

\description{
Add constraints to ensure that every planning unit is allocated to a
management zone in the solution. \strong{This function can only be used with
problems that contain multiple zones.}
}
\details{
For a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} with multiple
management zones, it may sometimes be desirable to obtain a solution that
assigns each and every single planning unit to a zone. For example, when
developing land-use plans, some decision makers may require that each and
every single parcel of land has been allocated a specific land-use type.
In other words are no "left over" areas. Although it might seem tempting
to simply solve the problem and manually assign "left over" planning units
to a default zone afterwards (e.g. an "other", "urban", or "grazing"
land-use), this could result in highly sub-optimal solutions if there
penalties for siting the default land-use adjacent to other zones.
Instead, this function can be used to specify that all planning units in a
problem with multiple zones must be allocated to a management zone (i.e.
zone allocation is mandatory).
