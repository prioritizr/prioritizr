\title{Add connectivity penalties}
\usage{
add_connectivity_penalties(x, penalty, connectivity_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.}

\item{penalty}{\code{numeric} penalty for missing connections between
planning units. This is equivalent to the connectivity strength modifier
(CSM; (XXX et al. XXXX). Defaults to one so that penalties are the
same as the values in the \code{data}.}

\item{connectivity_data}{\code{data.frame}, \code{matrix}, \code{\link[Matrix]{Matrix}}
object that shows the strength of connectivity between consecutive planning
units. If \code{data} is a matrix, then rows and columns represent
each planing unit and the cell values represent the connectivity between
them. If \code{data} is a \code{data.frame} the column names
be \code{"id1"}, \code{"id2"}, \code{"boundary"} where each row
shows the connectivity between two planning units (following the Marxan
format). The data can be describe symmetric or asymmetric
connectivity between planning units.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.
}
\description{
Add penalties to a conservation problem to favor solutions that select
planning units with high connectivity between them.
}
\examples{
# load data
data(sim_pu_points, sim_features)

# create a symmetric connectivity matrix where the connectivity between
# two planning units is the inverse distance between them
sc_matrix <- (1 / (as.matrix(dist(sim_pu_points@coords)) + 1))

# remove connections between planning unitswith little connectivity
sc_matrix[sc_matrix < 0.85] <- 0

# create basic problem
p1 <- problem(sim_pu_points, sim_features) \%>\%
  add_min_set_objective() \%>\%
  add_relative_targets(0.2)

# create problem with low connectivity penalties
p2 <- p1 \%>\% add_connectivity_penalties(25, sc_matrix)

# create problem with higher connectivity penalties
p3 <- p1 \%>\% add_connectivity_penalties(50, sc_matrix)

# create an asymmetric connectivity matrix where links from even numered
# units to odd numbered units have half the connectivity as from odd
# numbered units to even units
even_units <- seq(2, length(sim_pu_points), 2)
odd_units <- seq(1, length(sim_pu_points), 2)
ac_matrix <- sc_matrix
ac_matrix[even_units, odd_units] <- 0.5 * ac_matrix[even_units, odd_units]

# create problem with asymmetric connectivity and high penalties
p4 <- p1 \%>\% add_connectivity_penalties(50, ac_matrix)
