\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object.}

\item{penalty}{\code{numeric} penalty that is used to scale the importance
of selecting planning units with strong connectivity between them compared
to the main problem objective (e.g., solution cost when the argument to
\code{x} has a minimum set objective set using
\code{\link[=add_min_set_objective]{add_min_set_objective()}}). Higher \code{penalty} values
can be used to obtain solutions with a high degree of connectivity,
and smaller \code{penalty} values can be used to obtain solutions with a
small degree of connectivity. Note that negative \code{penalty} values can
be used to obtain solutions that have very little connectivity.}

\item{zones}{\code{matrix} or \code{Matrix} object describing the
neighborhood scheme for different zones. Each row and column corresponds
to a different zone in the argument to \code{x}, and cell values must
contain binary \code{numeric} values (i.e., one or zero) that indicate
if neighboring planning units (as specified in the argument to
\code{data}) should be considered neighbors if they are allocated to
different zones. The cell values along the diagonal
of the matrix indicate if planning units that are allocated to the same
zone should be considered neighbors or not. The default argument to
\code{zones} is an identity matrix (i.e., a matrix with ones along the
matrix diagonal and zeros elsewhere), so that planning units are
only considered neighbors if they are both allocated to the same zone.}

\item{data}{\code{NULL}, \code{matrix}, \code{Matrix}, \code{data.frame}, or
\code{array} object showing which planning units are neighbors with each
other. The argument defaults to \code{NULL} which means that the
neighborhood data is calculated automatically using the
\code{\link[=adjacency_matrix]{adjacency_matrix()}} function.
See the Data format section for more information.}
}
\value{
An updated \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} object with the penalties added to it.
}
\description{
Add penalties to a conservation planning problem to penalize solutions
that have few neighboring planning units. These penalties can be used
to promote spatial clustering in solutions. In particular, they are
recommended for reducing spatial fragmentation in large-scale problems
or when using open source solvers.
}
\details{
This function adds penalties to conservation planning problem to penalize
solutions that have low spatial clustering.
Specifically, it favors pair-wise connections between planning units
that have high connectivity values (based on Önal and Briers 2002).
}
\section{Mathematical formulation}{

The neighbor penalties are implemented using the following equations.
Let \eqn{I} represent the set of planning units
(indexed by \eqn{i} or \eqn{j}), \eqn{Z} represent the set
of management zones (indexed by \eqn{z} or \eqn{y}), and \eqn{X_{iz}}{Xiz}
represent the decision variable for planning unit \eqn{i} for in zone
\eqn{z} (e.g., with binary
values one indicating if planning unit is allocated or not). Also, let
\eqn{p} represent the argument to \code{penalty}, \eqn{D} represent the
argument to \code{data} , and \eqn{W} represent the argument
to \code{zones}.

If the argument to \code{data} is supplied as a \code{matrix} or
\code{Matrix} object, then the penalties are calculated as:

\deqn{
\sum_{i}^{I} \sum_{j}^{I} \sum_{z}^{Z} \sum_{y}^{Z} (-p \times X_{iz}
\times X_{jy} \times D_{ij} \times W_{zy})}{
sum_i^I sum_j^I sum_z^Z sum_y^Z (-p * Xiz * Xjy * Dij * Wzy)
}

Otherwise, if the argument to \code{data} is supplied as a
\code{data.frame} or \code{array} object, then the penalties are
calculated as:

\deqn{
\sum_{i}^{I} \sum_{j}^{I} \sum_{z}^{Z} \sum_{y}^{Z} (-p \times X_{iz}
\times X_{jy} \times D_{ijzy})}{
sum_i^I sum_j^I sum_z^Z sum_y^Z (-p * Xiz * Xjy * Dijzy)
}

Note that when the problem objective is to maximize some measure of
benefit and not minimize some measure of cost, the term \eqn{-p} is
replaced with \eqn{p}.
}

\section{Data format}{

The argument to \code{data} can be specified using the following formats:

\describe{

\item{\code{data} as a \code{NULL} value}{neighborhood data should be calculated
automatically
using the \code{\link[=adjacency_matrix]{adjacency_matrix()}} function. This is the default
argument. Note that the neighborhood data must be manually defined
using one of the other formats below when the planning unit data
in the argument to \code{x} is not spatially referenced (e.g.,
in \code{data.frame} or \code{numeric} format).}

\item{\code{data} as a \code{matrix}/\code{Matrix} object}{where rows and columns represent
different planning units and the value of each cell indicates if the
two planning units are neighbors or not. Cell values should be binary
\code{numeric} values (i.e., one or zero). Cells that occur along the
matrix diagonal have no effect on the solution at all because each
planning unit cannot be a neighbor with itself.}

\item{\code{data} as a \code{data.frame} object}{containing columns that are named
\code{"id1"}, \code{"id2"}, and \code{"boundary"}. Here, each row
denotes the connectivity between two planning units following the
\emph{Marxan} format. The \code{"boundary"} column should contain
binary \code{numeric} values that indicate if the two planning units
specified in the \code{"id1"} and \code{"id2"} columns are neighbors
or not. This data can be used to describe symmetric or
asymmetric relationships between planning units. By default,
input data is assumed to be symmetric unless asymmetric data is
also included (e.g., if data is present for planning units 2 and 3, then
the same amount of connectivity is expected for planning units 3 and 2,
unless connectivity data is also provided for planning units 3 and 2).
If the argument to \code{x} contains multiple zones, then the
\code{"zone1"} and \code{"zone2"} columns can optionally be provided to manually
specify if the neighborhood data pertain to specific zones. The
\code{"zone1"} and \code{"zone2"} columns should contain the \code{character}
names of the zones. If the columns \code{"zone1"} and \code{"zone2"}
are present, then the argument to \code{zones} must be \code{NULL}.}

\item{\code{data} as an \code{array} object}{containing four-dimensions where binary
\code{numeric} values indicate if planning unit should be treated
as being neighbors with every other planning unit when they
are allocated to every combination of management zone. The first two
dimensions (i.e., rows and columns) correspond to the planning units,
and second two dimensions correspond to the management zones. For
example, if the argument to \code{data} had a value of 1 at the index
\code{data[1, 2, 3, 4]} this would indicate that planning unit 1 and
planning unit 2 should be treated as neighbors when they are
allocated to zones 3 and 4 respectively.}
