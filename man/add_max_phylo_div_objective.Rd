\description{
Set the objective of a conservation planning \code{\link{problem}} to
maximize the phylogenetic diversity of the features represented in the
solution subject to a budget. This objective is similar to
\code{\link{add_max_features_objective}} except
that emphasis is placed on representing a phylogenetically diverse set of
species, rather than as many features as possible (subject to weights).
This function was inspired by Faith (1992) and Rodrigues \emph{et al.}
(2002).

\details{
A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
conservation planning problem. Please note that all conservation
planning problems formulated in the \pkg{prioritizr} package require the
addition of objectives---failing to do so will return an error
message when attempting to solve problem.

The maximum phylogenetic diversity objective finds the set of
planning units that meets representation targets for a phylogenetic tree
while staying within a fixed budget. If multiple solutions can meet all
targets while staying within budget, the cheapest solution is chosen.
Note that this objective is similar to the maximum
features objective (\code{\link{add_max_features_objective}}) in that it
allows for both a budget and targets to be set for each feature. However,
unlike the maximum feature objective, the aim of this objective is to
maximize the total phylogenetic diversity of the targets met in the
solution, so if multiple targets are provided for a single feature, the
problem will only need to meet a single target for that feature
for the phylogenetic benefit for that feature to be counted when
calculating the phylogenetic diversity of the solution. In other words,
for multi-zone problems, this objective does not aim to maximize the
phylogenetic diversity in each zone, but rather this objective
aims to maximize the phylogenetic diversity of targets that can be met
through allocating planning units to any of the different zones in a
problem. This can be useful for problems where targets pertain to the total
amount held for each feature across multiple zones. For example,
each feature might have a non-zero amount of suitable habitat in each
planning unit when the planning units are assigned to a (i) not restored,
(ii) partially restored, or (iii) completely restored management zone.
Here each target corresponds to a single feature and can be met through
the total amount of habitat in planning units present to the three
zones. In earlier versions of the \pkg{prioritizr} package, this
function was named \code{add_max_phylo_div_objective}.

The maximum phylogenetic diversity objective for the reserve design
problem can be expressed mathematically for a set of planning units
(\eqn{I}{I} indexed by \eqn{i}{i}) and a set of features (\eqn{J}{J}
indexed by \eqn{j}{j}) as:

\deqn{\mathit{Maximize} \space \sum_{i = 1}^{I} -s \space c_i \space x_i +
  \sum_{j = 1}^{J} m_b l_b \\
  \mathit{subject \space to} \\
  \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i r_{ij} \geq y_j t_j \forall j \in J \\
  m_b \leq y_j \forall j \in T(b) \\
  \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i c_i \leq B}{
  Maximize sum_i^I (-s * ci * xi) + sum_j^J (mb * lb) subject to sum_i^I
  (xi * rij) >= (yj * tj) for all j in J & mb <= yj for all j in T(b) &
  sum_i^I (xi * ci) <= B}

Here, \eqn{x_i}{xi} is the \code{\link{decisions}} variable (e.g.
specifying whether planning unit \eqn{i}{i} has been selected (1) or not
(0)), \eqn{r_{ij}}{rij} is the amount of feature \eqn{j}{j} in planning
unit \eqn{i}{i}, \eqn{t_j}{tj} is the representation target for feature
\eqn{j}{j}, \eqn{y_j}{yj} indicates if the solution has meet
the target \eqn{t_j}{tj} for feature \eqn{j}{j}. Additionally,
\eqn{T}{T} represents a phylogenetic tree containing features \eqn{j}{j}
and has the branches \eqn{b} associated within lengths \eqn{l_b}{lb}.
The binary variable \eqn{m_b}{mb} denotes if
at least one feature associated with the branch \eqn{b}{b} has met its
representation as indicated by \eqn{y_j}{yj}. For brevity, we denote
the features \eqn{j}{j} associated with branch \eqn{b}{b} using
\eqn{T(b)}{T(b)}. Finally, \eqn{B}{B} is the budget allocated for the
solution, \eqn{c_i}{ci} is the cost of planning unit \eqn{i}{i}, and
\eqn{s}{s} is a scaling factor used to shrink the costs so that the problem
will return a cheapest solution when there are multiple solutions that
represent the same amount of all features within the budget.
