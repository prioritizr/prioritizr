\usage{
new_waiver()
}
\value{
A \code{Waiver} object.
}
\description{
Create a \code{waiver} object.
}
\details{
This object is used to represent that the user has not manually
specified a setting, and so defaults should be used. By explicitly
using a \code{new_waiver()}, this means that \code{NULL} objects can be a
valid setting. The use of a waiver object was inspired by the
\code{ggplot2} package.
}
\examples{
# create new waiver object
w <- new_waiver()

# print object
print(w)
