\usage{
add_max_features_objective(x, budget)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=ConservationProblem-class]{ConservationProblem-class()}} object.}

\item{budget}{\code{numeric} value specifying the maximum expenditure of
the prioritization. For problems with multiple zones, the argument
to \code{budget} can be a single \code{numeric} value to specify a budget
for the entire solution or a \code{numeric} \code{vector} to specify
a budget for each each management zone.}

\value{
\code{\link[=ConservationProblem-class]{ConservationProblem-class()}} object with the objective
added to it.
}
\description{
Set the objective of a conservation planning \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} to
fulfill as many targets as possible while ensuring that the cost of the
solution does not exceed a budget.
}
\details{
A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
conservation planning problem. Please note that all conservation
planning problems formulated in the \pkg{prioritizr} package require the
addition of objectives---failing to do so will return an error
message when attempting to solve problem.

The maximum feature representation objective is an enhanced version of the
maximum coverage objective \code{\link[=add_max_cover_objective]{add_max_cover_objective()}} because
targets can be used to ensure that a certain amount of each feature is
required in order for them to be adequately represented (similar to the
minimum set objective (see \code{\link[=add_min_set_objective]{add_min_set_objective()}}). This
objective finds the set of planning units that meets representation targets
for as many features as possible while staying within a fixed budget
(inspired by Cabeza and Moilanen 2001). Additionally, weights can be used
\code{\link[=add_feature_weights]{add_feature_weights()}}). If multiple solutions can meet the same
number of weighted targets while staying within budget, the cheapest
solution is returned.

The maximum feature objective for the reserve design problem can be
expressed mathematically for a set of planning units (\eqn{I}{I} indexed by
\eqn{i}{i}) and a set of features (\eqn{J}{J} indexed by \eqn{j}{j}) as:

\deqn{\mathit{Maximize} \space \sum_{i = 1}^{I} -s \space c_i \space x_i +
  \sum_{j = 1}^{J} y_j w_j \\
  \mathit{subject \space to} \\
  \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i r_{ij} \geq y_j t_j \forall j \in J \\
  \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i c_i \leq B}{
  Maximize sum_i^I (-s * ci * xi) + sum_j^J (yj * wj) subject to
  sum_i^I (xi * rij) >= (yj tj) for all j in J &
  sum_i^I (xi * ci) <= B}

Here, \eqn{x_i}{xi} is the \link{decisions} variable (e.g.
specifying whether planning unit \eqn{i}{i} has been selected (1) or not
(0)), \eqn{r_{ij}}{rij} is the amount of feature \eqn{j}{j} in planning
unit \eqn{i}{i}, \eqn{t_j}{tj} is the representation target for feature
\eqn{j}{j}, \eqn{y_j}{yj} indicates if the solution has meet
the target \eqn{t_j}{tj} for feature \eqn{j}{j}, and \eqn{w_j}{wj} is the
weight for feature \eqn{j}{j} (defaults to 1 for all features; see
\code{\link[=add_feature_weights]{add_feature_weights()}} to specify weights). Additionally,
\eqn{B}{B} is the budget allocated for the solution, \eqn{c_i}{ci} is the
cost of planning unit \eqn{i}{i}, and \eqn{s}{s} is a scaling factor used
to shrink the costs so that the problem will return a cheapest solution
when there are multiple solutions that represent the same amount of all
features within the budget.
