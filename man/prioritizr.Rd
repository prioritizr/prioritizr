\title{prioritizr: Systematic Conservation Prioritization in R}
\description{
The \pkg{prioritizr R} package uses mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
techniques to provide a flexible interface for building and solving
conservation planning problems (Hanson \emph{et al.} 2024).
It supports a broad range of objectives, constraints, and penalties
that can be used to custom-tailor conservation planning problems to the
specific needs of a conservation planning exercise
(e.g., Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2000; Billionnet 2013). Once built, conservation
planning problems can be solved using a variety of commercial and
open-source exact algorithm solvers. In contrast to the algorithms
conventionally used to solve conservation problems, such as heuristics or
simulated annealing (Ball \emph{et al.} 2009), the exact algorithms used
here are guaranteed to find optimal solutions (Schuster \emph{et al.} 2020).
Furthermore, conservation problems can be constructed to optimize the
spatial allocation of different
management actions or zones, meaning that conservation practitioners can
identify solutions that benefit multiple stakeholders. Finally, this package
has the functionality to read input data formatted for the \emph{Marxan}
conservation planning program (Ball \emph{et al.} 2009), and find much
cheaper solutions in a much shorter period of time than \emph{Marxan} (Beyer
\emph{et al.} 2016). See the Hanson \emph{et al.} (2024) and the
\href{https://github.com/prioritizr/prioritizr}{online code repository}
for more information.
