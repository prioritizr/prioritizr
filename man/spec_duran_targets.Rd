\description{
Specify targets for a conservation planning problem following
Duran \emph{et al.} (2020).
Briefly, this target setting method involves using historical distribution
data to infer the minimum amount of habitat required for a species to meet
a pre-specified probability of persisting indefinitely.
Note that this function is designed to be used within \code{\link[=add_auto_targets]{add_auto_targets()}}
and \code{\link[=add_group_targets]{add_group_targets()}}.
}
\details{
This target setting method is derived from a framework for estimating
the impacts of anthropogenic activities at national and global scales
(Duran \emph{et al.} 2020).
It involves setting targets based on the minimum amount of
habitat required for a species to have a particular probability of
persistence.
Although the gold standard approach for estimating such an amount would
involve performing a population viability analysis
(e.g., Taylor \emph{et al.} 2017),
population viability analyses require a considerable amount of species-
specific data that are often not available for conservation planning
exercises (reviewed by Akçakaya and Sjögren-Gulve 2000).
As such, this method provides a less data intensive
alternative for setting targets based on desired probabilities of
persistence.

This target setting method is heavily dependent on particular assumptions.
In particular, it is based on the assumption that -- for a given species --
there is an
idealized distribution size (e.g., geographic range size) that would allow
for the species to have a 100\% chance of persisting indefinitely, and
decreases in this distribution size would be associated with
reductions in the probability of persistence
(Payne and Finnegan 2007; Purvis \emph{et al.} 2000).
Building on this assumption, it further assumes that (i) the historical
distribution of a species can reliably approximate its idealized
distribution size with
a 100\% chance of persisting indefinitely, and (ii)
proportionate decreases in the species' distribution size (relative to
its idealized distribution size) are associated
with increasingly greater reductions in probability of persistence
(i.e., following a power-law function with an exponent of 0.25)
(Balmford \emph{et al.} 2018; Brooks \emph{et al.} 1999; Thomas \emph{et al.} 2004).
Based on these assumptions, this method involves estimating the minimum
amount of habitat required to ensure that a species has, at least, a
particular probability of persistence, and then setting the species'
representation target accordingly.

The validity of this target setting method depends heavily on its
assumptions.
As such, great care should be taken to ensure that the
historical distribution of a species used to approximate its idealized
distribution does indeed have a (near) 100\% probability of persistence
(Durán et al. 2020).
Although the package does not provide historical distribution data,
such data can be derived from species distribution modeling techniques.
For example, one approach for characterizing the historical distribution
of a species is to fit an environmental niche model based on present-day
environmental data and then use historical environmental data to predict
the species' historical distribution (reviewed by Nogués‐Bravo 2009).
Another approach involves using the area of habitat framework
(reviewed by Brooks \emph{et al.} 2019) with information on a
species' habitat preferences,
current and former (i.e., now extinct) geographic ranges,
and historical land cover data (Eyres \emph{et al.} 2025).
Please note that this function is provided as convenient method to
set targets for problems with a single management zone, and cannot
be used for those with multiple management zones.

\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This method involves setting target thresholds based on the area
required to ensure that each feature meets a pre-specified
probability of persistence.
To express this mathematically, we will define the following terminology.
Let \eqn{f} denote the total abundance of a feature (e.g., current geographic
range size expressed as \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}),
\eqn{h} the historical total abundance of the feature (e.g., historical
range size expressed as \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}},
per \code{historical_area} and \code{area_units}),
and \eqn{p} the desired threshold probability of persistence for the
feature.
Given this terminology, the target threshold (\eqn{t}) for a feature
is calculated as follows.
\deqn{
t = min(f, h \times p^(1/0.25))
}{
t = min(f, h * p^(1/0.25))
}
}

\section{Target setting}{

Many conservation planning problems require targets.
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount, or proportion, of a
feature's spatial distribution that should ideally be protected.
This is important so that the optimization process can weigh the merits
and trade-offs between improving the representation of one feature over
another feature.
Although it can be challenging to set meaningful targets,
this is a critical step for ensuring that prioritizations
meet the stakeholder objectives that underpin a prioritization exercise
(Carwardine \emph{et al.} 2009).
In other words, targets play an important role in ensuring that a
priority setting process is properly tuned according to stakeholder
requirements.
For example, targets provide a mechanism for ensuring that a
prioritization secures enough habitat to promote the long-term persistence
of each threatened species, culturally important species,
or economically important ecosystem service under consideration.
Since there is often uncertainty regarding stakeholder objectives
(e.g., how much habitat should be protected for a given species)
or the influence of particular target on a prioritization
(e.g., how would setting a 90\% or 100\% for a threatened species alter
priorities), it is often useful to generate and compare a suite of
prioritizations based on different target scenarios.
}

\section{Data calculations}{

This function involves calculating targets based on the spatial extent
of the features in \code{x}.
As such, this function may need to make particular assumptions depending
on the data used to specify the planning units and features in \code{x}.
If possible, when building \code{x} with \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}, it is recommended to specify
\code{features} as a \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} object to ensure correctness.
Although this function can be used to specify targets for features
in other data formats, you must take care to ensure that the information
specifying the amount of each feature are in units of 1 km
\ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
To help ensure that you are aware of this limitation, this function will
produce a warning to alert you when the features in \code{x} belong to such
data formats.
If you are confident that your data are in the correct units,
then you can safely ignore this warning.
Below we provide details for ensuring that the targets are calculated
correctly.

\describe{
\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} or \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} planning units and \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}} features}{
This function will automatically ensure that the targets are calculated
correctly. Given this, it is recommended to specify \code{features} in either
of these when building a \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::st_sf()}} or \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{character} features}{
Here, the argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify
which columns of the planning unit data denote the amount of each feature
present within each planning unit.
All of these columns must contain values in
units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
For example, if \code{features = c("spp1", "spp2", "spp3")}, then the columns
\code{"spp1"}, \code{"spp2"}, and \code{"spp3"} of the planning unit denote data the amount
of the first, second, and third features (respectively) present within each
planning unit. If the column \code{"spp1"} has a value of 5 in the first row
of the planning unit data, then this means the first planning unit
contains 5 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}
of habitat for the feature \code{"spp1"}.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{data.frame} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij} must contain a \code{data.frame}
with the columns \code{"pu"}, \code{"species"}, \code{"amount"}. For a given row,
the \code{"pu"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the identifier
for the planning unit,
the \code{"species"} column contains an \code{integer} value denoting the
identifier for the feature,
and \verb{"amount" contains a }numeric\verb{value denoting the amount of the the feature (per the}"species"\verb{column) that is present in the planning unit (per}"pu"\verb{column). Given this, the "amount" column must contain values that in units of 1 km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}. For example, if the argument to}rij\verb{has a row where the}"pu"\verb{column has a value of 1, the}"species"\verb{column has a value of 2, and the}"amount"` column has a value of 3: then this means that the
planning unit with an identifier of 1 contains 3
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}} of the feature
associated with the identifier of 2.
}

\item{\code{x} has \code{numeric} or \code{matrix} planning units and \code{data.frame} features}{
The argument to \code{features} of \code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify a
unique identifier and name for each of the features.
Additionally, the argument to \code{rij_matrix} of
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}} is used to specify the amount of each feature present within
each planning unit. The argument to \code{rij_matrix} must contain a \code{matrix}
(or \code{list} of \code{matrix} objects) that contains \code{numeric} values in units of 1
km \ifelse{html}{\out{km<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{km^2}}.
