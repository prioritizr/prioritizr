The _prioritizr R_ package uses integer linear programming (ILP) techniques to provide a flexible interface for building and solving conservation planning problems. It supports a broad range of objectives, constraints, and penalties that can be used to custom-tailor conservation planning problems to the specific needs of a conservation planning exercise. Once built, conservation planning problems can be solved using a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm solvers. In contrast to the algorithms conventionally used to solve conservation problems, such as heuristics or simulated annealing, the exact algorithms used here are guaranteed to find optimal solutions. Furthermore, conservation problems can be constructed to optimize the spatial allocation of different management actions or zones, meaning that conservation practitioners can identify solutions that benefit multiple stakeholders. Finally, this package has the functionality to read input data formatted for the _Marxan_ conservation planning program, and find much cheaper solutions in a much shorter period of time than _Marxan_.

## Usage

Here we will provide a short example showing how the _prioritizr R_ package can be used to build and solve conservation problems. For brevity, we will use one of the built-in simulated data sets that is distributed with the package. First, we will load the _prioritizr R_ package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# load package
library(prioritizr)
```

We will use the `sim_pu_polygons` object to represent our planning units. Although the _prioritizr R_ can support many different types of planning unit data, here our planning units are represented as polygons in a spatial vector format (i.e. `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`). Each polygon represents a different planning unit and we have `r length(sim_pu_polygons)` planning units in total. The attribute table associated with this data set contains information describing the acquisition cost of each planning ("cost" column), and a value indicating if the unit is already located in protected area ("locked_in" column). Let's explore the planning unit data.

```{r, fig.height = h, fig.width = w, out.width=ow}
# load planning unit data
data(sim_pu_polygons)

# show the first 6 rows in the attribute table
head(sim_pu_polygons@data)

# plot the planning units and color them according to acquisition cost
spplot(sim_pu_polygons, "cost", main = "Planning unit cost",
       xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1))
```

```{r, fig.height = h, fig.width = w, out.width=ow}
# plot the planning units and show which planning units are inside protected
# areas (colored in yellow)
spplot(sim_pu_polygons, "locked_in", main = "Planning units in protected areas",
       xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1))
```

Conservation features are represented using a stack of raster data (i.e. `RasterStack` objects). A `RasterStack` represents a collection of `RasterLayers` with the same spatial properties (i.e. spatial extent, coordinate system, dimensionality, and resolution). Each `RasterLayer` in the stack describes the distribution of a conservation feature.

In our example, the `sim_features` object is a `RasterStack` object that contains `r raster::nlayers(sim_features)` layers. Each `RasterLayer` describes the distribution of a species. Specifically, the pixel values denote the proportion of suitable habitat across different areas inside the study area. For a given layer, pixels with a value of one are comprised entirely of suitable habitat for the feature, and pixels with a value of zero contain no suitable habitat.

```{r, fig.height = 3.25, fig.width = w * 2.0, out.width=as.character(as.numeric(ow) * 2)}
# load feature data
data(sim_features)

# plot the distribution of suitable habitat for each feature
plot(sim_features, main = paste("Feature", seq_len(nlayers(sim_features))),
     nr = 2)
```

Let's say that we want to develop a reserve network that will secure 20 % of the distribution for each feature in the study area for minimal cost. In this planning scenario, we can either purchase all of the land inside a given planning unit, or none of the land inside a given planning unit. Thus we will create a new [`problem`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/problem.html) that will use a minimum set objective ([`add_min_set_objective`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_min_set_objective.html)), with relative targets of 20 % ([`add_relative_targets`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_relative_targets.html)), and binary decisions ([`add_binary_decisions`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_binary_decisions.html)).

```{r}
# create problem
p1 <- problem(sim_pu_polygons, features = sim_features,
              cost_column = "cost") %>%
      add_min_set_objective() %>%
      add_relative_targets(0.2) %>%
      add_binary_decisions()
```

After we have built a [`problem`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/problem.html), we can solve it to obtain a solution. Since we have not specified the method used to solve the problem, _prioritizr_ will automatically use the best solver currently installed. **It is strongly encouraged to install the [Gurobi software suite and the _gurobi_ _R_ package to solve problems quickly](http://gurobi.com), for more information on this please refer to the [Gurobi Installation Guide](https://prioritizr.net/articles/gurobi_installation.html)**

```{r, fig.height = h, fig.width = w, out.width = ow}
# solve the problem
s1 <- solve(p1)

# extract the objective (cost of solution in this case)
print(attr(s1, "objective"))

# extract time spent solving the problem
print(attr(s1, "runtime"))

# extract state message from the solver
print(attr(s1, "status"))

# plot the solution
s1$solution_1 <- factor(s1$solution_1)
spplot(s1, "solution_1", col.regions = c('grey90', 'darkgreen'),
       main = "Solution", xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1))
```

Although this solution adequately conserves each feature, it is inefficient because it does not consider the fact some of the planning units are already inside protected areas. Since our planning unit data contains information on which planning units are already inside protected areas (in the `"locked_in"` column of the attribute table), we can add constraints to ensure they are prioritized in the solution ([`add_locked_in_constraints`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_locked_in_constraints.html)).

```{r, fig.height = h, fig.width = w, out.width = ow}
# create new problem with locked in constraints added to it
p2 <- p1 %>% add_locked_in_constraints("locked_in")

# solve the problem
s2 <- solve(p2)

# plot the solution
s2$solution_1 <- factor(s2$solution_1)
spplot(s2, "solution_1", col.regions = c('grey90', 'darkgreen'),
       main = "Solution", xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1))
```

This solution is an improvement over the previous solution. However, it is also highly fragmented. As a consequence, this solution may be associated with increased management costs and the species in this scenario may not benefit substantially from this solution due to edge effects. We can further modify the problem by adding penalties that punish overly fragmented solutions ([`add_boundary_penalties`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_boundary_penalties.html)). Here we will use a penalty factor of 1 (i.e. boundary length modifier; BLM), and an edge factor of 50 % so that planning units that occur outer edge of the study area are not overly penalized.

```{r, fig.height = h, fig.width = w, out.width = ow}
# create new problem with boundary penalties added to it
p3 <- p2 %>% add_boundary_penalties(penalty = 500, edge_factor = 0.5)

# solve the problem
s3 <- solve(p3)

# plot the solution
s3$solution_1 <- factor(s3$solution_1)
spplot(s3, "solution_1", col.regions = c('grey90', 'darkgreen'),
       main = "Solution", xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1))
```

This solution is even better then the previous solution. However, we are not finished yet. This solution does not maintain connectivity between reserves, and so species may have limited capacity to disperse throughout the solution. To avoid this, we can add contiguity constraints ([`add_contiguity_constraints`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_contiguity_constraints.html)).

```{r, fig.height = h, fig.width = w, out.width = ow}
# create new problem with contiguity constraints
p4 <- p3 %>% add_contiguity_constraints()

# solve the problem
s4 <- solve(p4)

# plot the solution
s4$solution_1 <- factor(s4$solution_1)
spplot(s4, "solution_1", col.regions = c('grey90', 'darkgreen'),
       main = "Solution", xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1))
```

This short example demonstrates how the _prioritizr R_ package can be used to build a minimal conservation problem, and how constraints and penalties can be iteratively added to the problem to obtain a solution. Although we explored just a few different functions for modifying the a conservation problem, the _prioritizr R_ package provides many functions for specifying objectives, constraints, penalties, and decision variables, so that you can build and custom-tailor a conservation planning problem to suit your exact planning scenario.
