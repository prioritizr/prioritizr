<a href="#summary" class="anchor"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>The <em>prioritizr R</em> package uses integer linear programming (ILP) techniques to provide a flexible interface for building and solving conservation planning problems <span class="citation">(Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2000; Billionnet 2013)</span>. It supports a broad range of objectives, constraints, and penalties that can be used to custom-tailor conservation planning problems to the specific needs of a conservation planning exercise. Once built, conservation planning problems can be solved using a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm solvers. In contrast to the algorithms conventionally used to solve conservation problems, such as heuristics or simulated annealing <span class="citation">(Ball <em>et al.</em> 2009)</span>, the exact algorithms used here are guaranteed to find optimal solutions. Furthermore, conservation problems can be constructed to optimize the spatial allocation of different management zone (or actions), meaning that conservation practitioners can identify solutions that benefit multiple stakeholders. Finally, this package has the functionality to read input data formatted for the <em>Marxan</em> conservation planning program <span class="citation">(Ball <em>et al.</em> 2009)</span>, and find much cheaper solutions in a much shorter period of time than <em>Marxan</em> <span class="citation">(Beyer <em>et al.</em> 2016)</span>.</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Systematic conservation planning is a rigorous, repeatable, and structured approach to designing new protected areas that efficiently meet conservation objectives <span class="citation">(Margules &amp; Pressey 2000)</span>. Historically, conservation decision-making has often evaluated parcels opportunistically as they became available for purchase, donation, or under threat. Although purchasing such areas may improve the <em>status quo</em>, such decisions may not substantially enhance the long-term persistence of target species or communities. Faced with this realization, conservation planners began using decision support tools to help simulate alternative reserve designs over a range of different biodiversity and management goals and, ultimately, guide protected area acquisitions and management actions. Due to the systematic, evidence-based nature of these tools, conservation prioritization can help contribute to a transparent, inclusive, and more defensible decision making process.</p>
<p>A conservation planning exercise typically starts by defining a study area. This study area should encompass all the areas relevant to the decision maker or the hypothesis being tested. The extent of a study area could encompass a few important localities <span class="citation">(e.g. Stigner <em>et al.</em> 2016)</span>, a single state <span class="citation">(e.g. Kirkpatrick 1983)</span>, an entire country <span class="citation">(Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2010)</span>, or the entire planet <span class="citation">(Butchart <em>et al.</em> 2015)</span>. Next, the study area is divided into a set of discrete areas termed <em>planning units</em>. Each planning unit represents a discrete locality in the study area that can be managed independently of other areas. The general idea is that some combination of the planning units can be selected for conservation actions (e.g. protected area establishment, habitat restoration). Planning units are often created as square or hexagon cells that are sized according to the scale of the conservation actions, and the resolution of the data that underpin the planning exercise <span class="citation">(but see Klein <em>et al.</em> 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>Cost data (or a surrogate thereof) are needed to inform the prioritization process. Specifically, these cost data describe the relative expenditure associated with managing each planning unit for conservation. For example, if the goal of the conservation planning exercise is to identify priority areas for expanding a local protected area system, then the cost data could represent the physical cost of purchasing the land. Alternatively, if such data are not available, then surrogate data could are often used instead (e.g. human population density, opportunity cost of foregone commercial activities, or planning unit size).</p>
<p>Conservation planning exercises also require data on the biodiversity elements that are of conservation interest (termed <em>conservation features</em>). These features could be species (e.g. <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>, the Clouded Leopard), populations, or habitats (e.g. mangroves or cloud forest). After identifying the set of relevant conservation features for a conservation planning exercise, spatially explicit data need to be obtained for each and every feature to describe their spatial distribution (e.g. habitat suitability data, probability of occurrence data, presence/absence data). This is important to ensure that conservation features are adequately covered (represented) by prioritizations. After assembling all the data, the next step is to define the conservation planning problem.</p>
<p>The <em>prioritizr R</em> package is designed to help you build and solve conservation planning problems. Specifically, prioritizations are generated by using formulating a mathematical optimization problem and then solving it to generate a solution. These mathematical optimization problems are formulated using the planning unit data, cost data, and feature data, and with information related to the overarching aim of the prioritization process. In general, the goal of an optimization problem is to minimize (or maximize) an <em>objective function</em> that is calculated using a set of <em>decision variables</em>, subject to a series of constraints to ensure that solution exhibits specific properties. The objective function describes the quantity which we are trying to minimize (e.g. cost of the solution) or maximize (e.g. number of features conserved). The decision variables describe the entities that we can control, and indicate which planning units are selected for conservation management and which of those are not. The constraints can be thought of as rules that the need decision variables need to follow. For example, a commonly used constraint is specifying that the solution must not exceed a certain budget.</p>
<p>A wide variety of approaches have been developed for solving optimization problems. Reserve design problems are frequently solved using simulated annealing <span class="citation">(Kirkpatrick <em>et al.</em> 1983)</span> or heuristics <span class="citation">(Nicholls &amp; Margules 1993; Moilanen 2007)</span>. These methods are conceptually simple and can be applied to a wide variety of optimization problems. However, they do not scale well for large or complex problems <span class="citation">(Beyer <em>et al.</em> 2016)</span>. Additionally, these methods cannot tell you how close any given solution is to the optimal solution. The <em>prioritizr R</em> package uses exact algorithms to efficiently solve conservation planning problems to within a pre-specified a optimality gap. In other words, you can specify that you need the optimal solution (i.e. a gap of 0%) and the algorithms will, given enough time, find a solution that meets this criteria. In the past, exact algorithms have been too slow for conservation planning exercises <span class="citation">(Pressey <em>et al.</em> 1996)</span>. However, improvements over the last decade mean that they are now much faster <span class="citation">(Achterberg &amp; Wunderling 2013; Beyer <em>et al.</em> 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>In this package, optimization problems are expressed using <em>integer linear programming</em> (ILP) so that they can be solved using (linear) exact algorithm solvers. The general form of an integer programming problem can be expressed in matrix notation using the following equation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Minimize} \space \boldsymbol{c}^\text{T} \boldsymbol{x} \space
\space \text{subject to} \space A\boldsymbol{x}
\space \Box \space \boldsymbol{b}\]</span></p>
<p>Here, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a vector of decision variables, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are vectors of known coefficients, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the constraint matrix. The final term specifies a series of structural constants and the <span class="math inline">\(\Box\)</span> symbol is used to indicate that the relational operators for the constraints can be either <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>. In the context of a conservation planning problem, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> could be used to represent the planning unit costs, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> could be used to store the data showing the presence / absence (or amount) of each feature in each planning unit, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> could be used to represent minimum amount of habitat required for each species in the solution, the <span class="math inline">\(\Box\)</span> could be set to <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> symbols to indicate that the total amount of each feature in the solution must exceed the quantities in <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. But there are many other ways of formulating the reserve selection problem <span class="citation">(Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2000)</span>.</p>

<div id="package-work-flow" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#package-work-flow" class="anchor"></a>Package work flow</h2>
<p>The general work flow when using the <em>prioritizr R</em> package starts with creating a new conservation planning <code>problem</code> object using data. Specifically, the <code>problem</code> object should be constructed using data that specify the planning units, biodiversity features, management zones (if applicable), and costs. After creating a new <code>problem</code> object, it can be customized—by adding objectives, penalties, constraints, and other information—to build a precise representation of the conservation planning problem required, and then solved to obtain a solutions.</p>
<p>All conservation planning problems require an objective. An objective specifies the property which is used to compare different feasible solutions. Simply put, the objective is the property of the solution which should be maximized or minimized during the optimization process. For instance, with the minimum set objective (specified using <code>add_min_set_objective</code>), we are seeking to minimize the cost of the solution (similar to <em>Marxan</em>). On the other hand, with the maximum coverage objective (specified using <code>add_max_cover_objective</code>), we are seeking to maximize the number of different features represented in the solution.</p>
<p>Many objectives require <code>targets</code> (e.g. the minimum set objective). Targets are a specialized set of constraints that relate to the total quantity of each feature secured in the solution (e.g. amount of suitable habitat or number of individuals). In the case of the minimum set objective ( <code>add_min_set_objective</code>), they are used to ensure that solutions secure a sufficient quantity of each feature, and in other objectives, such as the maximum features objective ( <code>add_max_features_objective</code>) they are used to assess whether a feature has been adequately conserved by a candidate solution. Targets can be expressed numerically as the total amount required for a given feature (using <code>add_absolute_targets</code>), or as a proportion of the total amount found in the planning units (using <code>add_relative_targets</code>). Note that not all objectives require targets, and a warning will be thrown if an attempt is made to add targets to a problem with an objective that does not use them.</p>
<p>Constraints and penalties can be added to a conservation planning problem to ensure that solutions exhibit a specific property or penalize solutions which don’t exhibit a specific property (respectively). The difference between constraints and penalties, strictly speaking, is constraints are used to rule out potential solutions that don’t exhibit a specific property. For instance, constraints can be used to ensure that specific planning units are selected in the solution for prioritization (using <code>add_locked_in_constraints</code>) or not selected in the solution for prioritization (using <code>add_locked_out_constraints</code>). On the other hand, penalties are combined with the objective of a problem, with a penalty factor, and the overall objective of the problem then becomes to minimize (or maximize) the primary objective function and the penalty function. For example, penalties can be added to a problem to penalize solutions that are excessively fragmented (using <code>add_boundary_penalties</code>). These penalties have a <code>penalty</code> argument that specifies the relative importance of having spatially clustered solutions. When the argument to <code>penalty</code> is high, then solutions which are less fragmented are valued more highly—even if they cost more—and when the argument to <code>penalty</code> is low, then the solutions which are more fragmented are valued less highly.</p>
<p>After building a conservation problem, it can then be solved to obtain a solution (or portfolio of solutions if desired). The solution is returned in the same format as the planning unit data used to construct the problem. This means that if raster or shapefile / vector data was used when initializing the problem, then the solution will also be in raster or shapefile / vector data. This can be very helpful when it comes to interpreting and visualizing solutions because it means that the solution data does not first have to be merged with spatial data before they can be plotted on a map.</p>

<a href="#usage" class="anchor"></a>Usage</h2>
<p>Here we will provide an introduction to using the <em>prioritizr R</em> package to build and solve a conservation planning problem. Please note that we will not discuss conservation planning with multiple zones in this vignette, for more information on working with multiple management zones please see the <a href="zones.html">zones vignette</a>.</p>
<p>First, we will load the <em>prioritizr</em> package.</p>

<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#data" class="anchor"></a>Data</h3>
<p>Now we will load some built-in data sets that are distributed with the <em>prioritizr R</em> package. This package contains several different planning unit data sets. To provide a comprehensive overview of the different ways that we can initialize a conservation planning problem, we will load each of them.</p>
<p>First, we will load the raster planning unit data (<code>sim_pu_raster</code>). Here, the planning units are represented as a raster (i.e. a <code>RasterLayer</code> object) and each pixel corresponds to the spatial extent of each panning unit. The pixel values correspond to the acquisition costs of each planning unit.</p>

<p><img src="prioritizr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="700" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Secondly, we will load one of the spatial vector planning unit data sets (<code>sim_pu_polygons</code>). Here, each polygon (i.e. feature using ArcGIS terminology) corresponds to a different planning unit. This data set has an attribute table that contains additional information about each polygon. Namely, the <code>cost</code> field (column) in the attribute table contains the acquisition cost for each planning unit.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we will load some planning unit data stored in tabular format (i.e. <code>data.frame</code> format). For those familiar with <em>Marxan</em> or dealing with very large conservation planning problems (&gt; 10 million planning units), it may be useful to work with data in this format because it does not contain any spatial information which will reduce computational burden. When using tabular data to initialize conservation planning problems, the data must follow the conventions used by <em>Marxan</em>. Specifically, each row in the planning unit table must correspond to a different planning unit. The table must also have an “id” column to provide a unique integer identifier for each planning unit, and it must also have a column that indicates the cost of each planning unit. For more information, please see the <a href="https://marxansolutions.org/">official <em>Marxan</em> documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we will load data showing the spatial distribution of the conservation features. Our conservation features (<code>sim_features</code>) are represented as a stack of raster objects (i.e. a <code>RasterStack</code> object) where each layer corresponds to a different feature (e.g. a multi-band GeoTIFF where each band corresponds to a different feature). The pixel values in each layer correspond to the amount of suitable habitat available in a given planning unit. Note that our planning unit raster layer and our conservation feature stack have exactly the same spatial properties (i.e. resolution, extent, coordinate reference system) so their pixels line up perfectly.</p>

For an exhaustive description of all the ways you can initialize a conservation problem, see the help file for the <code>problem</code> function (which you can open using the code <code><a href="../reference/problem.html">?problem</a></code>).

<p>Generally, we recommend initializing problems using raster data where possible. This is because the <code>problem</code> function needs to calculate the amount of each feature in each planning unit, and by providing both the planning unit and feature data in raster format with the same spatial resolution, extents, and coordinate systems, this means that the <code>problem</code> function does not need to do any geo-processing behind the scenes. But sometimes we can’t use raster planning unit data because our planning units aren’t equal-sized grid cells. So, below is an example showing how we can initialize a conservation planning problem using planning units that are formatted as spatial vector data. Note that if we had pre-computed the amount of each feature in each planning unit and stored the data in the attribute table, we could pass in the names of the columns as an argument to the <code>problem</code> function.</p>

<p>We can also initialize a conservation planning problem using tabular planning unit data (i.e. a <code>data.frame</code>). Since the tabular planning unit data does not contain any spatial information, we also have to provide the feature data in tabular format (i.e. a <code>data.frame</code>) and data showing the amount of each feature in each planning unit in tabular format (i.e. a <code>data.frame</code>). The feature data must have an “id” column containing a unique integer identifier for each feature, and the planning unit by feature data must contain the following three columns: “pu” corresponding to the planning unit identifiers, “species” corresponding to the feature identifiers, and “amount” showing the amount of a given feature in a given planning unit.</p>

<p>For more information on initializing problems, please see the help page for the <code>problem</code> function (which you can open using the code <code><a href="../reference/problem.html">?problem</a></code>). Now that we have initialized a conservation planning problem, we will show you how you can customize it to suit the exact needs of your conservation planning scenario. Although we initialized the conservation planning problems using several different methods, moving forward, we will only use raster-based planning unit data to keep things simple.</p>
</div>
<div id="add-an-objective" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#add-an-objective" class="anchor"></a>Add an objective</h3>
<p>The next step is to add an objective to the problem. A problem objective is used to specify the primary goal of the problem (i.e. the quantity that is to be maximized or minimized). All conservation planning problems involve minimizing or maximizing some kind of objective. For instance, we might require a solution that conserves enough habitat for each species while minimizing the overall cost of the reserve network. Alternatively, we might require a solution that maximizes the number of conserved species while ensuring that the cost of the reserve network does not exceed the budget. Please note that objectives are added in the same way regardless of the type of data used to initialize the problem.</p>
<p>The <em>prioritizr R</em> package supports a variety of different objective functions.</p>

<strong>Minimum set objective</strong>: Minimize the cost of the solution whilst ensuring that all targets are met <span class="citation">(Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2000)</span>.

<strong>Maximum utility objective</strong>: Secure as much of the features as possible without exceeding a budget. This objective is functionally equivalent to selecting the planning units with the greatest amounts of each feature (e.g. species richness). Generally, we don’t encourage the use of this objective because it will only rarely identify complementary solutions—solutions which adequately conserve a range of different features—except perhaps to explore trade-offs or provide a baseline solution with which to compare other solutions.</li>

<a href="#add-targets" class="anchor"></a>Add targets</h3>
<p>Most conservation planning problems require targets. Targets are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a feature’s distribution that needs to be protected in the solution. For example, we may want to develop a reserve network that will secure 20% of the distribution for each feature for minimal cost.</p>
<p>There are four ways for specifying targets in the <em>prioritizr R</em> package:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Absolute targets</strong>: Targets are expressed as the total amount of each feature in the study area that need to be secured. For example, if we had binary feature data that showed the absence or presence of suitable habitat across the study area, we could set an absolute target as 5 to mean that we require 5 planning units with suitable habitat in the solution.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Relative targets</strong>: Targets are set as a proportion (between 0 and 1) of the total amount of each feature in the study area. For example, if we had binary feature data and the feature occupied a total of 20 planning units in the study area, we could set a relative target of 50 % to specify that the solution must secure 10 planning units for the feature. We could alternatively specify an absolute target of 10 to achieve the same result, but sometimes proportions are easier to work with.</li>

<strong>Mandatory allocation constraints</strong>: Add constraints to ensure that every planning unit is allocated to a management zone in the solution. Please note that this function can only be used with problems that contain multiple zones. For more information on problems with multiple zones and an example using this function, see the Management Zones vignette.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, The <code>add_locked_in_constraints</code> and <code>add_locked_out_constraints</code> functions are incredibly useful for real-world conservation planning exercises, so it’s worth pointing out that there are several ways we can specify which planning units should be locked in or out of the solutions. If we use raster planning unit data, we can also use raster data to specify which planning units should be locked in our locked out.</p>

<a href="#add-penalties" class="anchor"></a>Add penalties</h3>
<p>We can also add penalties to a problem to favor or penalize solutions according to a secondary objective. Unlike the constraint functions, these functions will add extra information to the objective function of the optimization function to penalize solutions that do not exhibit specific characteristics. For example, penalties can be added to a problem to avoid highly fragmented solutions at the expense of accepting slightly more expensive solutions. All penalty functions have a <code>penalty</code> argument that controls the relative importance of the secondary penalty function compared to the primary objective function. It is worth noting that incredibly low or incredibly high <code>penalty</code> values—relative to the main objective function—can cause problems to take a very long time to solve, so when trying out a range of different penalty values it can be helpful to limit the solver to run for a set period of time.</p>
<p>The <em>prioritizr R</em> package currently offers only two methods for adding penalties to a conservation planning problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Boundary penalties</strong>: Add penalties to penalize solutions that are excessively fragmented. These penalties are similar to those used in <em>Marxan</em> <span class="citation">(Ball <em>et al.</em> 2009; Beyer <em>et al.</em> 2016)</span>.</li>

<a href="#add-the-decision-types" class="anchor"></a>Add the decision types</h3>
<p>Conservation planning problems involve making decisions on how planning units will be managed. These decisions are then associated with management actions (e.g. turning a planning unit into a protected area). The type of decision describes how the action is applied to planning units. For instance, the default decision-type is a binary decision type, meaning that we are either selecting or not selecting planning units for management.</p>
<p>The <em>prioritizr R</em> package currently offers the following types of decisions for customizing problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Binary decisions</strong>: Add a binary decision to a conservation planning problem. This is the classic decision of either prioritizing or not prioritizing a planning unit. Typically, this decision has the assumed action of buying the planning unit to include in a protected area network. If no decision is added to a problem object, then this decision class will be used by default.</li>

<strong>Proportion decisions</strong>: Add a proportion decision to a problem. This is a relaxed decision where a part of a planning unit can be prioritized, as opposed to the default of the entire planning unit. Typically, this decision has the assumed action of buying a fraction of a planning unit to include in a protected area network. Generally, problems can be solved much faster with proportion-type decisions than binary-type decisions, so they can be very useful when commercial solvers are not available.</li>

<strong>Semi-continuous decisions</strong>: Add a semi-continuous decision to a problem. This decision is similar to proportion decisions except that it has an upper bound parameter. By default, the decision can range from prioritizing none (0%) to all (100%) of a planning unit. However, a upper bound can be specified to ensure that at most only a fraction (e.g. 80%) of a planning unit can be purchased. This type of decision may be useful when it is not practical to conserve the entire area indicated by a planning unit.</li>

<p>We can plot this solution because the planning unit input data are spatially referenced in a raster format. The output format will always match the planning unit data used to initialize the problem. For example, the solution to a problem with planning units in a spatial vector (shapefile) format would also be in a spatial vector format. Similarly, if the planning units were in a tabular format (i.e. <code>data.frame</code>), the solution would also be returned in a tabular format.</p>

<p>Although users are encouraged to build and tailor conservation planning problems to suit their own needs using the <code>problem</code> function, sometimes it just simply easier to use a more familiar formulation. The <code>marxan_problem</code> function is provided as a convenient wrapper for building and solving <em>Marxan</em>-style conservation problems. If users already have their conservation planning data formatted for use with <em>Marxan</em>, this function can also read <em>Marxan</em> data files and solve the <em>Marxan</em>-style problems using exact algorithm solvers. <strong>Please note that problems built using the <code>marxan_problem</code> function are still solved the same way as a problem initialized using the <code>problem</code> function, and therefore still require the installation of one of the solver packages.</strong></p>
<p>Here is a short example showing how the <code>marxan_problem</code> function can be used to read <em>Marxan</em> input files and the <code>solve</code> function can be used to solve the problem.</p>

<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#importance-irreplaceability" class="anchor"></a>Importance (irreplaceability)</h3>
<p>Conservation plans can take a long time to implement. Since funding availability and habitat quality can decline over time, it is critical that the most important places in a prioritization are scheduled for protection as early as possible. For instance, some planning units in a solution might contain many rare species which do not occur in any other planning units. Alternatively, some planning units might offer an especially high return on investment that reduces costs considerably. As a consequence, conservation planners often need information on which planning units selected in a prioritization are most important to the overall success of the prioritization. To achieve this, conservation planners can use importance (irreplaceability) scores for each planning unit selected in a solution.</p>
<p>The <em>prioritizr R</em> package offers multiple methods for assessing importance. These includes scores calculated based on replacement costs <span class="citation">(<code><a href="../reference/eval_replacement_importance.html">eval_replacement_importance()</a></code>; Cabeza &amp; Moilanen 2006)</span>, Ferrier <em>et al.</em> <span class="citation">(2000)</span> (<code><a href="../reference/eval_ferrier_importance.html">eval_ferrier_importance()</a></code>), and rarity weighted richness scores <span class="citation">(<code><a href="../reference/eval_rare_richness_importance.html">eval_rare_richness_importance()</a></code>; Williams <em>et al.</em> 1996)</span>. The replacement cost scores quantify the change in the objective function (e.g. additional costs required to meet feature targets) of the optimal solution if a given planning unit in a solution cannot be acquired. They can (i) account for the cost of different planning units, (ii) account for multiple management zones, (iii) apply to any objective function, and (iv) identify truly irreplaceable planning units (denoted with infinite values). The Ferrier scores quantify the importance of planning units for meeting feature targets. They can only be applied to conservation problems with a minimum set objective and a single zone (i.e. the classic <em>Marxan</em>-type problem). Furthermore—unlike the replacement cost scores—the Ferrier scores provide a score for each feature within each planning unit, providing insight into why certain planning units are more important than other planning units. The rarity weighted richness scores are simply a measure of biological diversity. They do not account for planning costs, multiple management zones, objective functions, or feature targets (or weightings). They merely describe the spatial patterns of biodiversity, and do not account for many of the factors needed to quantify the importance of a planning unit for achieving conservation goals.</p>
<p>We recommend using replacement cost scores for small and moderate sized problems (e.g. less than 30,000 planning units) when it is feasible to do so. It can take a very long time to compute replacement cost scores, and so it is simply not feasible to compute these scores for particularly large problems. For moderate and large sized problems (e.g. more than 30,000 planning units), we recommend using the rarity weighted richness scores. Beware, it has been known for decades that such static measures of biodiversity lead to poor conservation plans <span class="citation">(Kirkpatrick 1983)</span>. Although the Ferrier method is also provided, we do not recommend using this method until it has been verified by a statistical expert.</p>
<p>Below we will generate a solution, and then calculate importance scores for the planning units selected in the solution using the three different methods.</p>

<a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully, this vignette has provided an informative introduction to the <em>prioritizr R</em> package. For more worked examples using the <em>prioritizr R</em> package, check out the <a href="tasmania.html">Tasmania</a> and <a href="saltspring.html">Salt Spring Island</a> vignettes. Perhaps, one of the best ways to learn a new piece of software is to just try it out. Test it, try breaking it, make mistakes, and learn from them. We would recommend trying to build conservation planning problems that resemble those you face in your own work—but using the built-in example data sets. This way you can quickly verify that the problems you build actually mean what you think they mean. For instance, you can try playing around with the targets and see what effect they have on the solutions, or try playing around with penalties and see what effect they have on the solutions. Finally, if you have any questions about using the <em>prioritizr R</em> package or suggestions for it, please file an issue on the package’s online coding repository (<a href="https://github.com/prioritizr/prioritizr/issues" class="uri">https://github.com/prioritizr/prioritizr/issues</a>).</p>
