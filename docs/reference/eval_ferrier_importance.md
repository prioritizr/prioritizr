# Evaluate solution importance using Ferrier scores

Calculate importance scores for planning units selected in a solution
following Ferrier *et al.* (2000).

## Usage

``` r
eval_ferrier_importance(x, solution)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  [`problem()`](https://prioritizr.net/reference/problem.md) object.

- solution:

  `numeric`, `matrix`, `data.frame`,
  [`terra::rast()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/rast.html),
  or [`sf::sf()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html)
  object. Note that `solution` must have the same format as the planning
  unit data in `x`. See the Solution format section for more
  information.

## Value

A `matrix`,
[`tibble::tibble()`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble.html),
[`terra::rast()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/rast.html),
or [`sf::st_sf()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html)
object containing the scores for each planning unit selected in the
solution. Specifically, the returned object is in the same format
(except if the planning units are a `numeric` vector) as the planning
unit data in `x`.

## Details

Importance scores are reported separately for each feature within each
planning unit. Additionally, a total importance score is also calculated
as the sum of the scores for each feature. Note that this function only
works for problems that use targets and a single zone. It will throw an
error for problems that do not meet these criteria.

## Notes

In previous versions, the documentation for this function had a warning
indicating that the mathematical formulation for this function required
verification. The mathematical formulation for this function has since
been corrected and verified, so now this function is recommended for
general use.

## Solution format

Broadly speaking, `solution` must be in the same format as the planning
unit data in `x`. Further details on the correct format are listed
separately for each of the different planning unit data formats.

- `x` has `numeric` planning units:

  Here `solution` must be a `numeric` vector with each element
  corresponding to a different planning unit. It should have the same
  number of planning units as those in `x`. Additionally, any planning
  units with missing cost (`NA`) values should also have missing (`NA`)
  values in the `solution`.

- `x` has `matrix` planning units:

  Here `solution` must be a `matrix` vector with each row corresponding
  to a different planning unit, and each column correspond to a
  different management zone. It should have the same number of planning
  units and zones as those in `x`. Additionally, any planning units with
  missing cost (`NA`) values for a particular zone should also have a
  missing (`NA`) values in `solution`.

- `x` has
  [`terra::rast()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/rast.html)
  planning units:

  Here `solution` be a
  [`terra::rast()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/rast.html)
  object where different cells correspond to different planning units
  and layers correspond to a different management zones. It should have
  the same dimensionality (rows, columns, layers), resolution, extent,
  and coordinate reference system as the planning units in `x`.
  Additionally, any planning units with missing cost (`NA`) values for a
  particular zone should also have missing (`NA`) values in `solution`.

- `x` has `data.frame` planning units:

  Here `solution` must be a `data.frame` with each column corresponding
  to a different zone, each row corresponding to a different planning
  unit, and cell values corresponding to the solution value. This means
  that if a `data.frame` object containing the solution also contains
  additional columns, then these columns will need to be subsetted prior
  to using this function (see below for example with
  [`sf::sf()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html) data).
  Additionally, any planning units with missing cost (`NA`) values for a
  particular zone should also have missing (`NA`) values in `solution`.

- `x` has [`sf::sf()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html)
  planning units:

  Here `solution` must be a
  [`sf::sf()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html) object
  with each column corresponding to a different zone, each row
  corresponding to a different planning unit, and cell values
  corresponding to the solution value. This means that if the
  [`sf::sf()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html) object
  containing the solution also contains additional columns, then these
  columns will need to be subsetted prior to using this function (see
  below for example). Additionally, `solution` must also have the same
  coordinate reference system as the planning unit data. Furthermore,
  any planning units with missing cost (`NA`) values for a particular
  zone should also have missing (`NA`) values in `solution`.
