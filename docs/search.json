OptimizationProblem objects simply wrapper external pointer pointer (XPtr) points C++ OPTIMIZATIONPROBLEM class object (defined src/optimization_problem.h). C++ OPTIMIZATIONPROBLEM class contains standard data needed formulate mixed integer linear programming problem (.e., model sense, problem objective , constraint matrix, constraint senses, right-hand-side values, variable decision types, variable bounds). class also contains additional data pertain conservation problems (.e., number features, planning units, zones). ’re unfamiliar standard representation mixed integer linear programming problem, encourage read documentation gurobi R package. fields A_i, A_j, A_x correspond row, column, cells values constraint matrix optimization problem (respectively). fields follow standard conventions. Note constraint matrix , ultimately, constructed Matrix::sparseMatrix() row column indices need sequential. Additionally, C++ constraint penalty functions independent. words, though may computationally efficient reuse constraints variables encoded functions, C++ constraint penalty function define constraints variables. conservation planning problems defined following one two standard mathematical formulations: compressed expanded formulation. compressed formulation defines problem assumes instances conserved feature used achieve target count towards benefit solution. Although expanded formulation can provide identical solutions compressed formulation, compressed formulation provided simpler can used much larger sized problems. Currently, constraints use compressed formulation except add_feature_contiguity_constraints() function. formulation, first set decision variables (first number planning units \\times number zones) always pertain state planning units. Thus problem containing 3 planning units 2 zones, first six variables indicate allocation : planning unit 1 zone 1, planning unit 2 zone 1, planning unit 3 zone 1, planning unit 1 zone 2, planning unit 2 zone 2, planning unit 3 zone 2. first set constraints (rows) always correspond target (noting objectives use “fake” targets initialize feature planning unit data, see R/compile.R). rows, correspond single target, contain amount feature zone target pertains. Thus rows targets pertain single zone contain feature abundance data planning units (columns) single zone, rows targets pertain single feature multiple zones contain feature abundance data planning units (columns) multiple zones. help illustrate compressed formulation, consider following problem: compressed formulation expresses planning unit feature data using following constraint matrix. , variable (column) corresponds different planning unit different zone allocation, constraint (row) corresponds different target, cell corresponds amount feature planning unit given different zone (based rij data targets). expanded formulation, hand, defines problem can allow instances conserved features used achieving targets maximizing conservation benefit. formulation generalized version compressed formulation. contains additional variables (columns) constraints (rows) combination feature, planning unit, zone indicate given planning unit allocated specific zone also allocated conserve given feature.

Since different criteria may conflict one another – align perfectly – prioritizations need make trade-offs different criteria (Klein et al. 2013). Although criteria can easily accounted using locked constraints representation targets (e.g., Dorji et al. 2020; Hermoso et al. 2018), always case (e.g., Beger et al. 2010). example, prioritizations often need balance overall cost overall level spatial fragmentation among reserves (Hermoso et al. 2011; Stewart & Possingham 2005). Additionally, prioritizations often need balance overall level connectivity among reserves criteria (Hermoso et al. 2012).

Thus need find suitable range penalty values can generate set candidate prioritizations. can find suitable range penalty values generating set preliminary prioritizations. preliminary prioritizations based different penalty values – similar process generating candidate prioritizations – solved using customized settings sacrifice optimality fast run times (see details). especially important specifying penalty value high cause optimization process take long time generate solutions (due numerical scaling issues mentioned previously). find suitable range penalty values, need identify upper limit penalty value (.e., highest penalty value result prioritization containing single reserve). Let’s create preliminary penalty identify upper limit. Please note might need adjust prelim_upper value find upper limit analyzing different datasets.

Historically, conservation decision-making often evaluated parcels opportunistically became available purchase, donation, threat. Although purchasing areas may improve status quo, decisions may substantially enhance long-term persistence target species communities. Faced realization, conservation planners began using decision support tools help simulate alternative reserve designs range different biodiversity management goals , ultimately, guide protected area acquisitions management actions. Due systematic, evidence-based nature tools, conservation prioritization can help contribute transparent, inclusive, defensible decision making process. conservation planning exercise typically starts defining study area. study area encompass areas relevant decision maker hypothesis tested. extent study area encompass important localities (e.g., Stigner et al. 2016), single state (e.g., Kirkpatrick 1983), entire country (Fuller et al. 2010), entire planet (Butchart et al. 2015). Next, study area divided set discrete areas termed planning units. planning unit represents discrete locality study area can managed independently areas. general idea combination planning units can selected conservation actions (e.g., protected area establishment, habitat restoration). Planning units often created square hexagon cells sized according scale conservation actions, resolution data underpin planning exercise (see Klein et al. 2009). Cost data (surrogate thereof) needed inform prioritization process. Specifically, cost data describe relative expenditure associated managing planning unit conservation. example, goal conservation planning exercise identify priority areas expanding local protected area system, cost data represent physical cost purchasing land. Alternatively, data available, surrogate data often used instead (e.g., human population density, opportunity cost foregone commercial activities, planning unit size). Conservation planning exercises also require data biodiversity elements conservation interest (termed conservation features). features species (e.g., Neofelis nebulosa, Clouded Leopard), populations, habitats (e.g., mangroves cloud forest). identifying set relevant conservation features conservation planning exercise, spatially explicit data need obtained every feature describe spatial distribution (e.g., habitat suitability data, probability occurrence data, presence/absence data). important ensure conservation features adequately covered (represented) prioritizations. assembling data, next step define conservation planning problem. prioritizr R package designed help build solve conservation planning problems. Specifically, prioritizations generated formulating mathematical optimization problem solving generate solution. mathematical optimization problems formulated using planning unit data, cost data, feature data, information related overarching aim prioritization process. general, goal optimization problem minimize (maximize) objective function calculated using set decision variables, subject series constraints ensure solution exhibits specific properties. objective function describes quantity trying minimize (e.g., cost solution) maximize (e.g., number features conserved). decision variables describe entities can control, indicate planning units selected conservation management . constraints can thought rules decision variables need follow. example, commonly used constraint specifying solution must exceed certain budget. wide variety approaches developed solving optimization problems. Reserve design problems frequently solved using simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983) heuristics (Nicholls & Margules 1993; Moilanen 2007). methods conceptually simple can applied wide variety optimization problems. However, scale well large complex problems (Beyer et al. 2016). Additionally, methods tell close given solution optimal solution. prioritizr package uses exact algorithms efficiently solve conservation planning problems within pre-specified optimality gap. words, can specify need optimal solution (.e., gap 0%) algorithms , given enough time, find solution meets criteria. past, exact algorithms slow conservation planning exercises (Pressey et al. 1996). However, improvements last decade mean now much faster (Achterberg & Wunderling 2013; Beyer et al. 2016). package, optimization problems expressed using integer linear programming (ILP) can solved using (linear) exact algorithm solvers. general form integer programming problem can expressed matrix notation using following equation. \\text{Minimize} \\space \\boldsymbol{c}^\\text{T} \\boldsymbol{x} \\space \\space \\text{subject } \\space \\boldsymbol{x} \\space \\Box \\space \\boldsymbol{b} x vector decision variables, c b vectors known coefficients, constraint matrix. final term specifies series structural constants \\Box symbol used indicate relational operators constraints can either \\geq, =, \\leq. context conservation planning problem, c used represent planning unit costs, used store data showing presence / absence (amount) feature planning unit, b used represent minimum amount habitat required species solution, \\Box set \\geq symbols indicate total amount feature solution must exceed quantities b. many ways formulating reserve selection problem (Rodrigues et al. 2000).","code":""},{"path":"https://prioritizr.net/articles/package_overview.html","id":"a-grammar-for-conservation-planning","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"A grammar for conservation planning","title":"Package overview","text":"prioritizr R package uses grammar describe elements conservation planning. means functions organized verbs relate specific concepts. example, functions used specify primary objective optimization end _objective suffix (e.g., add_min_set_objective() add_min_shortfall_objective()). combining multiple functions together, can used formulate complete conservation planning problem.

Alternatively, might require solution maximizes number conserved species ensuring cost reserve network exceed budget. Please note objectives added way regardless type data used initialize problem. following objectives available. Minimum set objective: Minimize cost solution whilst ensuring targets met (Rodrigues et al. 2000). objective similar used Marxan (Ball et al. 2009). example, can add minimum set objective problem using following code. Maximum cover objective: Represent least one instance many features possible within given budget (Church et al. 1996). Maximum features objective: Fulfill many targets possible ensuring cost solution exceed budget (inspired Cabeza & Moilanen 2001). object similar maximum cover objective except option later specifying targets feature. practice, objective useful maximum cover objective features often require certain amount area persist simply capturing single instance habitat feature generally unlikely enhance long-term persistence. Minimum shortfall objective: Minimize overall (weighted sum) shortfall many targets possible ensuring cost solution exceed budget. practice, objective useful large amount left-budget using maximum feature representation objective remaining funds need allocated places enhance representation features unmet targets. Minimum largest shortfall objective: Minimize largest (maximum) shortfall ensuring cost solution exceed budget. practice, objective useful minimum shortfall objective returns solutions focus much representing small number features (e.g., occur much cheaper planning units), solutions needed spread conservation effort evenly among features—even means features (relatively) poor representation. Maximum phylogenetic diversity objective: Maximize phylogenetic diversity features represented solution subject budget (inspired Faith 1992; Rodrigues & Gaston 2002). objective similar maximum features objective except emphasis placed protecting features associated diverse range evolutionary histories. package contains simulated phylogeny can used simulated feature data (sim_phylogny). Maximum phylogenetic endemism objective: Maximize phylogenetic endemism features represented solution subject budget (inspired Faith 1992; Rodrigues & Gaston 2002; Rosauer et al. 2009). objective similar maximum phylogenetic diversity except emphasis placed conserving features associated geographically restricted periods evolutionary history rather diverse range evolutionary histories. Maximum utility objective: Maximize weighted sum features represented solution much possible without exceeding budget. objective functionally equivalent selecting planning units greatest amounts feature (e.g., weighted species richness). Generally, don’t encourage use objective rarely identify complementary solutions – solutions adequately conserve range different features – except perhaps explore trade-offs provide baseline solution compare solutions. Minimum penalties objective: Minimize penalties added problem, whilst ensuring al targets met cost solution exceed budget. objective useful using hierarchical approach multi-objective optimization.","code":"# create a new problem that has the minimum set objective p3 <-   problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) %>%   add_min_set_objective()  # print problem print(p3) ##

Let’s generate prioritization can compare different importance methods.  following methods available computing importance scores. Replacement cost: Evaluate importance using replacement cost method (Cabeza & Moilanen 2006). method quantifies importance given planning unit decrease performance solution (based objective function) planning unit acquired (e.g., terms additional costs required meet feature targets). advantages method () accounts costs planning units, (ii) can applied multiple management zones, (iii) can applied objective function, (iv) can identify truly irreplaceable planning units (denoted infinite values). However, key disadvantage method, can take infeasible amount time complete large complex problems. * Incremental ranks: Evaluate importance scores calculating ranks via incremental optimization process (Jung et al. 2021). Briefly, approach involves generating incremental prioritizations increasing budgets, wherein planning units selected previous increment locked following solution. Additionally, locked constraints used ensure planning units selected original solution available selection. advantages approach can () computed relatively quickly relatively large problems, (ii) account cost different planning units, (iii) account multiple management zones, (iv) apply solutions generated using objective function. * Ferrier method: Evaluate importance computing irreplaceability scores following Ferrier et al. (2000). advantages method () can computed relatively quickly moderate problems, (ii) calculates score feature within planning unit provide insight certain planning units important others. disadvantage method can applied conservation problems use targets single zone (.e., similar Marxan-type problems). * Rarity weighted richness: Evaluate importance computing rarity weighted richness scores (Williams et al. 1996). advantage method can computed quickly large problems. key disadvantage approach merely describes spatial patterns biodiversity, consider goals underpin conservation planning exercise. instance, account planning costs, management zones, objective functions, feature representation targets.  general, recommend using replacement cost scores small moderate sized problems (e.g., less 30,000 planning units) feasible . can take long time compute replacement cost scores, simply feasible compute scores particularly large problems. moderate large sized problems (e.g., 30,000 planning units), recommend using Ferrier method. explicitly accounts representation targets, unlike rarity weighted richness scores. almost never recommend using rarity weighted richness scores. consider criteria needed inform conservation decision making (Brown et al. 2015).","code":"# formulate the problem p47 <-   problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) %>%   add_min_set_objective() %>%   add_relative_targets(0.1) %>%   add_binary_decisions()  # solve the problem s47 <- solve(p47) ## Set parameter Username ## Set parameter LicenseID to value 2599748 ## Set parameter TimeLimit to value 2147483647 ## Set parameter MIPGap to value 0.1 ## Set parameter Presolve to value 2 ## Set parameter Threads to value 1 ## Academic license -

Conservation planning problems built using marxan_problem() function can also customized. example, change decision type mp2 involve selecting proportion planing unit (using add_proportion_decisions() function).","code":"# set file path for Marxan input file minput <- system.file(\"extdata/marxan/input.dat\", package = \"prioritizr\")  # read Marxan input file mp <- marxan_problem(minput)  # print problem print(mp) ## A conservation problem (<ConservationProblem>) ## ├•data ## │├•features:    \"bird1\", \"nvis2\", \"nvis8\", \"nvis9\", \"nvis14\", \"nvis20\", … (17 total) ## │└•planning units: ## │ ├•data:       <spec_tbl_df> (1751 total) ## │ ├•costs:      continuous values (between 0 and 415692.2) ## │ ├•extent:     NA ## │ └•CRS:        NA ## ├•formulation ## │├•objective:   minimum set objective ## │├•penalties: ## ││└•1:          boundary penalties (`penalty` = 1, `edge_factor` = 1, `formulation` = \"simple\", …) ## │├•targets:     relative targets (between 0.3 and 0.3}) ## │├•constraints: ## ││├•1:          locked in constraints (317 planning units) ## ││└•2:          locked out constraints (1 planning units) ## │└•decisions:   binary decision ## └•optimization ##  ├•portfolio:   default portfolio ##  └•solver:      gurobi solver (`gap` = 0.1, `time_limit` = 2147483647, `first_feasible` = FALSE, …) ## # ℹ Use `summary(...)` to see complete formulation. # solve the problem ms <- solve(mp) ## Set parameter Username ## Set parameter LicenseID to value 2599748 ## Set parameter TimeLimit to value 2147483647 ## Set parameter MIPGap to value 0.1 ## Set parameter Presolve to value 2 ## Set parameter Threads to value 1 ## Academic license - for non-commercial use only - expires 2025-12-16 ## Gurobi Optimizer version 12.0.2 build v12.0.2rc0 (linux64 - \"Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\") ##  ## CPU model: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1185G7 @ 3.00GHz, instruction set [SSE2|AVX|AVX2|AVX512] ## Thread count: 4 physical cores, 8 logical processors, using up to 1 threads ##  ## Non-default parameters: ## TimeLimit  2147483647 ## MIPGap  0.1 ## LogToConsole  0 ## Presolve  2 ## Threads  1 ##  ## Optimize a model with 10075 rows, 6780 columns and 24778 nonzeros ## Model fingerprint: 0x49c86f37 ## Variable types: 5029 continuous, 1751 integer (1751 binary) ## Coefficient statistics: ##   Matrix range     [5e-05, 4e+03] ##   Objective range  [8e+03, 4e+05] ##   Bounds range     [1e+00, 1e+00] ##   RHS range        [5e+03, 3e+05] ## Found heuristic solution: objective 1.255825e+08 ## Presolve removed 4707 rows and 3103 columns ## Presolve time: 0.05s ## Presolved: 5368 rows, 3677 columns, 12704 nonzeros ## Variable types: 0 continuous, 3677 integer (3677 binary) ## Root relaxation presolved: 5368 rows, 3677 columns, 12704 nonzeros ##  ##  ## Root relaxation: objective 9.975843e+07, 652 iterations, 0.01 seconds (0.02 work units) ##  ##     Nodes    |    Current Node    |     Objective Bounds      |     Work ##  Expl Unexpl |  Obj  Depth IntInf | Incumbent    BestBd   Gap | It/Node Time ##  ##      0     0 9.9758e+07    0   43 1.2558e+08 9.9758e+07  20.6%     -    0s ## H    0     0                    1.021771e+08 9.9758e+07  2.37%     -    0s ##  ## Cleanup yields a better solution ##  ## Explored 1 nodes (652 simplex iterations) in 0.07 seconds (0.12 work units) ## Thread count was 1 (of 8 available processors) ##  ## Solution count 3: 1.02121e+08 1.02177e+08 1.25582e+08  ##  ## Optimal solution found (tolerance 1.00e-01) ## Best objective 1.021211480564e+08, best bound 9.975842517354e+07, gap 2.3136% # since the Marxan data was in a tabular format, the solution is also returned # in a tabular format, so we will print the first six rows of the table # containing the solution head(ms) ## # A tibble: 6 × 8 ##      id    cost status     xloc      yloc locked_in locked_out solution_1 ##   <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl> <lgl>     <lgl>           <dbl> ## 1     3      0       0 1116623. -4493479.

Although prioritizr R package can support many different types feature data, feature data represented multi-layer raster (.e., terra::rast() object). layer describes spatial distribution feature. , feature data correspond different bird species. account migratory patterns, breeding non-breeding distributions species represented different features. Specifically, cell values denote relative abundance individuals, higher values indicating greater abundance.  Let’s make sure solver installed computer. important can use optimization algorithms generate spatial prioritizations. first time using prioritizr R package, please install HiGHS solver using following R code. Although HiGHS solver relatively fast easy install, please note ’ll need install Gurobi software suite gurobi R package best performance (see Gurobi Installation Guide details). Now, let’s generate spatial prioritization. ensure feasibility, set budget. Specifically, total cost prioritization represent 5% total land value study area. Given budget, want prioritization increase feature representation, much possible, feature , ideally, 20% distribution covered prioritization. scenario, can either purchase land inside given planning unit, none land inside given planning unit. Thus create new problem() use minimum shortfall objective (via add_min_shortfall_objective()), relative targets 20% (via add_relative_targets()), binary decisions (via add_binary_decisions()), specify want near-optimal solutions (.e., 10% optimality) using best solver installed computer (via add_default_solver()). built problem(), can solve obtain solution.  generating solution, important evaluate . , calculate number planning units selected solution, total cost solution. can also check many representation targets met solution. Although solution helps meet representation targets, account existing protected areas inside study area. , account possibility features partially – even fully – represented existing protected areas , turn, might fail identify meaningful priorities new protected areas. address issue, use get_wa_locked_in() function import spatial data protected areas study area. add constraints problem() ensure selected solution (via add_locked_in_constraints()).   solution improvement previous solution. However, places study area available protected area establishment (e.g., due land tenure). consequence, solution might practical implementation, might select places available protection. address issue, use get_wa_locked_out() function import spatial data describing planning units available protection. add constraints problem() ensure selected solution (via add_locked_out_constraints()).   solution even better previous solution. However, finished yet. planning units selected solution fairly fragmented. can cause issues fragmentation increases management costs reduces conservation benefits edge effects. address issue, can modify problem adding penalties punish overly fragmented solutions (via add_boundary_penalties()). use penalty factor (.e., boundary length modifier) 0.003, edge factor 50% planning units occur outer edge study area overly penalized.  Now, let’s explore planning units selected solution important cost-effectively meeting targets. achieve , calculate importance (irreplaceability) scores using incremental rank approach. Briefly, optimization problem solved multiple times incremental process increasing budgets, planning units assigned ranks based increment selected . Planning units selected earlier process considered important.  short example demonstrates prioritizr R package can used build customize conservation problems, solve generate solutions. Although explored just different functions modifying conservation problem, package provides many functions specifying objectives, constraints, penalties, decision variables, can build custom-tailor conservation planning problems suit planning scenario.","code":"# load packages library(prioritizr) library(prioritizrdata) library(terra) # import planning unit data wa_pu <- get_wa_pu()  # preview data print(wa_pu) ##

First, need create set planning units (.e., discrete spatial areas) inform decision making. Planning units often created subdividing study region set square hexagonal cells. can also created using administrative boundaries (e.g., provinces), land management boundaries (e.g., property boundaries derived cadastral data), ecological boundaries (e.g., based ecosystem classification data). size (.e., spatial grain) planning units often determined based compromise scale needed inform decision making, spatial accuracy (resolution) available datasets, computational resources available generating prioritizations (e.g., RAM number CPU cores computer). Second, need data quantify cost implementing management action within planning unit.
