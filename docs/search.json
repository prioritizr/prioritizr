OptimizationProblem objects simply wrapper external pointer pointer (XPtr) points C++ OPTIMIZATIONPROBLEM class object (defined src/optimization_problem.h). C++ OPTIMIZATIONPROBLEM class contains standard data needed formulate mixed integer linear programming problem (.e., model sense, problem objective , constraint matrix, constraint senses, right-hand-side values, variable decision types, variable bounds). class also contains additional data pertain conservation problems (.e., number features, planning units, zones). ’re unfamiliar standard representation mixed integer linear programming problem, encourage read documentation gurobi R package. fields A_i, A_j, A_x correspond row, column, cells values constraint matrix optimization problem (respectively). fields follow standard conventions. Note constraint matrix , ultimately, constructed Matrix::sparseMatrix() row column indices need sequential. Additionally, C++ constraint penalty functions independent. words, though may computationally efficient reuse constraints variables encoded functions, C++ constraint penalty function define constraints variables. conservation planning problems defined following one two standard mathematical formulations: compressed expanded formulation. compressed formulation defines problem assumes instances conserved feature used achieve target count towards benefit solution. Although expanded formulation can provide identical solutions compressed formulation, compressed formulation provided simpler can used much larger sized problems. Currently, constraints use compressed formulation except add_feature_contiguity_constraints() function. formulation, first set decision variables (first number planning units × number zones) always pertain state planning units. Thus problem containing 3 planning units 2 zones, first six variables indicate allocation : planning unit 1 zone 1, planning unit 2 zone 1, planning unit 3 zone 1, planning unit 1 zone 2, planning unit 2 zone 2, planning unit 3 zone 2. first set constraints (rows) always correspond target (noting objectives use “fake” targets initialize feature planning unit data, see R/compile.R). rows, correspond single target, contain amount feature zone target pertains. Thus rows targets pertain single zone contain feature abundance data planning units (columns) single zone, rows targets pertain single feature multiple zones contain feature abundance data planning units (columns) multiple zones. help illustrate compressed formulation, consider following problem: compressed formulation expresses planning unit feature data using following constraint matrix. , variable (column) corresponds different planning unit different zone allocation, constraint (row) corresponds different target, cell corresponds amount feature planning unit given different zone (based rij data targets). expanded formulation, hand, defines problem can allow instances conserved features used achieving targets maximizing conservation benefit. formulation generalized version compressed formulation. contains additional variables (columns) constraints (rows) combination feature, planning unit, zone indicate given planning unit allocated specific zone also allocated conserve given feature.

Since different criteria may conflict one another – align perfectly – prioritizations need make trade-offs different criteria (Klein et al. 2013). Although criteria can easily accounted using locked constraints representation targets (e.g., Dorji et al. 2020; Hermoso et al. 2018), always case (e.g., Beger et al. 2010). example, prioritizations often need balance overall cost overall level spatial fragmentation among reserves (Hermoso et al. 2011; Stewart & Possingham 2005). Additionally, prioritizations often need balance overall level connectivity among reserves criteria (Hermoso et al. 2012). Since best trade-depends range factors – available budgets, species’ connectivity requirements, management capacity – finding best balance can challenging. prioritizr R package provides multi-objective optimization methods help identify best trade-offs different criteria. achieve , conservation planning problem can formulated primary objective (e.g., add_min_set_objective()) penalties (e.g., add_boundary_penalties()) relate criteria. building problem, nature trade-offs can specified using certain parameters (e.g., penalty parameter add_boundary_penalties() function). identify prioritization finds best balance different criteria, trade-parameters can tuned using calibration analysis. analyses – context systematic conservation planning – typically involve generating set candidate prioritizations based different parameters, measuring performance according criteria, selecting prioritization (set prioritizations) based well achieve criteria (Hermoso et al. 2011; Stewart & Possingham 2005; Hermoso et al. 2012). example, Marxan decision support tool range parameters (e.g., species penalty factors, boundary length modifier) calibrated balance cost, species’ representation, spatial fragmentation (Ardron et al. 2010). aim tutorial provide guidance calibrating trade-offs using prioritizr R package. explore couple different approaches generating candidate prioritizations, methods finding best balance different criteria.

Historically, conservation decision-making often evaluated parcels opportunistically became available purchase, donation, threat. Although purchasing areas may improve status quo, decisions may substantially enhance long-term persistence target species communities. Faced realization, conservation planners began using decision support tools help simulate alternative reserve designs range different biodiversity management goals , ultimately, guide protected area acquisitions management actions. Due systematic, evidence-based nature tools, conservation prioritization can help contribute transparent, inclusive, defensible decision making process. conservation planning exercise typically starts defining study area. study area encompass areas relevant decision maker hypothesis tested. extent study area encompass important localities (e.g., Stigner et al. 2016), single state (e.g., Kirkpatrick 1983), entire country (Fuller et al. 2010), entire planet (Butchart et al. 2015). Next, study area divided set discrete areas termed planning units. planning unit represents discrete locality study area can managed independently areas. general idea combination planning units can selected conservation actions (e.g., protected area establishment, habitat restoration). Planning units often created square hexagon cells sized according scale conservation actions, resolution data underpin planning exercise (see Klein et al. 2009). Cost data (surrogate thereof) needed inform prioritization process. Specifically, cost data describe relative expenditure associated managing planning unit conservation. example, goal conservation planning exercise identify priority areas expanding local protected area system, cost data represent physical cost purchasing land. Alternatively, data available, surrogate data often used instead (e.g., human population density, opportunity cost foregone commercial activities, planning unit size). Conservation planning exercises also require data biodiversity elements conservation interest (termed conservation features). features species (e.g., Neofelis nebulosa, Clouded Leopard), populations, habitats (e.g., mangroves cloud forest). identifying set relevant conservation features conservation planning exercise, spatially explicit data need obtained every feature describe spatial distribution (e.g., habitat suitability data, probability occurrence data, presence/absence data). important ensure conservation features adequately covered (represented) prioritizations. assembling data, next step define conservation planning problem. prioritizr R package designed help build solve conservation planning problems. Specifically, prioritizations generated formulating mathematical optimization problem solving generate solution. mathematical optimization problems formulated using planning unit data, cost data, feature data, information related overarching aim prioritization process. general, goal optimization problem minimize (maximize) objective function calculated using set decision variables, subject series constraints ensure solution exhibits specific properties. objective function describes quantity trying minimize (e.g., cost solution) maximize (e.g., number features conserved). decision variables describe entities can control, indicate planning units selected conservation management . constraints can thought rules decision variables need follow. example, commonly used constraint specifying solution must exceed certain budget. wide variety approaches developed solving optimization problems. Reserve design problems frequently solved using simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983) heuristics (Nicholls & Margules 1993; Moilanen 2007). methods conceptually simple can applied wide variety optimization problems. However, scale well large complex problems (Beyer et al. 2016). Additionally, methods tell close given solution optimal solution. prioritizr package uses exact algorithms efficiently solve conservation planning problems within pre-specified optimality gap. words, can specify need optimal solution (.e., gap 0%) algorithms , given enough time, find solution meets criteria. past, exact algorithms slow conservation planning exercises (Pressey et al. 1996). However, improvements last decade mean now much faster (Achterberg & Wunderling 2013; Beyer et al. 2016). package, optimization problems expressed using integer linear programming (ILP) can solved using (linear) exact algorithm solvers. general form integer programming problem can expressed matrix notation using following equation. \\[\\text{Minimize} \\space \\boldsymbol{c}^\\text{T} \\boldsymbol{x} \\space \\space \\text{subject } \\space \\boldsymbol{x} \\space \\Box \\space \\boldsymbol{b}\\] \\(x\\) vector decision variables, \\(c\\) \\(b\\) vectors known coefficients, \\(\\) constraint matrix. final term specifies series structural constants \\(\\Box\\) symbol used indicate relational operators constraints can either \\(\\geq\\), \\(=\\), \\(\\leq\\). context conservation planning problem, \\(c\\) used represent planning unit costs, \\(\\) used store data showing presence / absence (amount) feature planning unit, \\(b\\) used represent minimum amount habitat required species solution, \\(\\Box\\) set \\(\\geq\\) symbols indicate total amount feature solution must exceed quantities \\(b\\). many ways formulating reserve selection problem (Rodrigues et al. 2000).","code":""},{"path":"https://prioritizr.net/articles/package_overview.html","id":"a-grammar-for-conservation-planning","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"A grammar for conservation planning","title":"Package overview","text":"prioritizr R package uses grammar describe elements conservation planning. means functions organized verbs relate specific concepts. example, functions used specify primary objective optimization end _objective suffix (e.g., add_min_set_objective() add_min_shortfall_objective()). combining multiple functions together, can used formulate complete conservation planning problem.

Replacement cost: Evaluate importance using replacement cost method (Cabeza & Moilanen 2006). method quantifies importance given planning unit decrease performance solution (based objective function) planning unit acquired (e.g., terms additional costs required meet feature targets). advantages method () accounts costs planning units, (ii) can applied multiple management zones, (iii) can applied objective function, (iv) can identify truly irreplaceable planning units (denoted infinite values).

Specifically, use example dataset available prioritizrdata R package. Additionally, use terra R package perform raster calculations. begin , load packages. use Washington dataset example. import planning unit data, use get_wa_pu() function. Although prioritizr R package can support many different types planning unit data, planning units represented single-layer raster (.e., terra::rast() object). cell represents different planning unit, cell values denote land acquisition costs. Specifically, 10757 planning units total (.e., cells non-missing values).  Next, use get_wa_features() function import conservation feature data. Although prioritizr R package can support many different types feature data, feature data represented multi-layer raster (.e., terra::rast() object). layer describes spatial distribution feature. , feature data correspond different bird species. account migratory patterns, breeding non-breeding distributions species represented different features. Specifically, cell values denote relative abundance individuals, higher values indicating greater abundance.  Let’s make sure solver installed computer. important can use optimization algorithms generate spatial prioritizations. first time using prioritizr R package, please install HiGHS solver using following R code. Although HiGHS solver relatively fast easy install, please note ’ll need install Gurobi software suite gurobi R package best performance (see Gurobi Installation Guide details). Now, let’s generate spatial prioritization. ensure feasibility, set budget. Specifically, total cost prioritization represent 5% total land value study area. Given budget, want prioritization increase feature representation, much possible, feature , ideally, 20% distribution covered prioritization. scenario, can either purchase land inside given planning unit, none land inside given planning unit. Thus create new problem() use minimum shortfall objective (via add_min_shortfall_objective()), relative targets 20% (via add_relative_targets()), binary decisions (via add_binary_decisions()), specify want near-optimal solutions (.e., 10% optimality) using best solver installed computer (via add_default_solver()). built problem(), can solve obtain solution.  generating solution, important evaluate . , calculate number planning units selected solution, total cost solution. can also check many representation targets met solution. Although solution helps meet representation targets, account existing protected areas inside study area. , account possibility features partially – even fully – represented existing protected areas , turn, might fail identify meaningful priorities new protected areas. address issue, use get_wa_locked_in() function import spatial data protected areas study area. add constraints problem() ensure selected solution (via add_locked_in_constraints()).   solution improvement previous solution. However, places study area available protected area establishment (e.g., due land tenure). consequence, solution might practical implementation, might select places available protection. address issue, use get_wa_locked_out() function import spatial data describing planning units available protection. add constraints problem() ensure selected solution (via add_locked_out_constraints()).   solution even better previous solution. However, finished yet. planning units selected solution fairly fragmented. can cause issues fragmentation increases management costs reduces conservation benefits edge effects. address issue, can modify problem adding penalties punish overly fragmented solutions (via add_boundary_penalties()). use penalty factor (.e., boundary length modifier) 0.003, edge factor 50% planning units occur outer edge study area overly penalized.  Now, let’s explore planning units selected solution important cost-effectively meeting targets. achieve , calculate importance (irreplaceability) scores using Ferrier method. Although method produces scores feature separately, examine total scores summarize overall importance across features.  short example demonstrates prioritizr R package can used build customize conservation problems, solve generate solutions.

Furthermore, planning units missing cost (NA) values particular zone also missing (NA) values argument solution.","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://prioritizr.net/reference/eval_target_coverage_summary.html","id":"ref-examples","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Examples","title":"Evaluate target coverage by solution — eval_target_coverage_summary","text":"","code":"# \\dontrun{ # set seed for reproducibility set.seed(500)  # load data sim_pu_raster <- get_sim_pu_raster() sim_pu_polygons <- get_sim_pu_polygons() sim_features <- get_sim_features() sim_zones_pu_polygons <- get_sim_zones_pu_polygons() sim_zones_features <- get_sim_zones_features()  # build minimal conservation problem with raster data p1 <-   problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) %>%   add_min_set_objective() %>%   add_relative_targets(0.1) %>%   add_binary_decisions() %>%   add_default_solver(verbose = FALSE)  # solve the problem s1 <- solve(p1)  # print solution print(s1) #> class       : SpatRaster  #> dimensions  : 10, 10, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr) #> resolution  : 0.1, 0.1  (x, y) #> extent      : 0, 1, 0, 1  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) #> coord. ref. : Undefined Cartesian SRS  #> source(s)   : memory #> varname     : sim_pu_raster  #> name        : layer  #> min value   :     0  #> max value   :     1   # plot solution plot(s1, main = \"solution\", axes = FALSE)   # calculate target coverage by the solution r1 <- eval_target_coverage_summary(p1, s1) print(r1, width = Inf) # note: `width = Inf` tells R to print all columns #> # A tibble: 5 × 9 #>   feature   met   total_amount absolute_target absolute_held absolute_shortfall #>   <chr>     <lgl>        <dbl>           <dbl>         <dbl>              <dbl> #> 1 feature_1 TRUE          83.3            8.33          8.91                  0 #> 2 feature_2 TRUE          31.2            3.12          3.13                  0 #> 3 feature_3 TRUE          72.0            7.20          7.34                  0 #> 4 feature_4 TRUE          42.7            4.27          4.35                  0 #> 5 feature_5 TRUE          56.7            5.67          6.01                  0 #>   relative_target relative_held relative_shortfall #>             <dbl>         <dbl>              <dbl> #> 1             0.1         0.107                  0 #> 2             0.1         0.100                  0 #> 3             0.1         0.102                  0 #> 4             0.1         0.102                  0 #> 5             0.1         0.106                  0  # build minimal conservation problem with polygon data p2 <-   problem(sim_pu_polygons, sim_features, cost_column = \"cost\") %>%   add_min_set_objective() %>%   add_relative_targets(0.1) %>%   add_binary_decisions() %>%   add_default_solver(verbose = FALSE)  # solve the problem s2 <- solve(p2)  # print first six rows of the attribute table print(head(s2)) #> Simple feature collection with 6 features and 4 fields #> Geometry type: POLYGON #> Dimension:     XY #> Bounding box:  xmin: 0 ymin: 0.9 xmax: 0.6 ymax: 1 #> Projected CRS: Undefined Cartesian SRS #> # A tibble: 6 × 5 #>    cost locked_in locked_out solution_1                                     geom #>   <dbl> <lgl>     <lgl>           <dbl>                            <POLYGON [m]> #> 1  216.

First, need create set planning units (.e., discrete spatial areas) inform decision making.
