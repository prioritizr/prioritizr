#' Add a penalty
#'
#' A penalty can be applied to a conservation planning [problem()] to
#' penalize solutions according to a specific metric. Penalties---unlike
#' [constraints]---act as an explicit trade-off with the objective
#' being minimized or maximized (e.g., solution cost when used with
#' [add_min_set_objective()]).
#'
#' @details Both penalties and constraints can be used to modify a problem and
#'   identify solutions that exhibit specific characteristics. Constraints work
#'   by invalidating solutions that do not exhibit specific characteristics.
#'   On the other hand, penalties work by specifying trade-offs against the
#'   main problem objective and are mediated by a penalty factor.
#'
#'   The following penalties can be added to a conservation planning
#'   [problem()]:
#'
#'   \describe{
#'
#'   \item{[add_boundary_penalties()]}{Add penalties to a
#'     conservation problem to favor solutions that have
#'     planning units clumped together into contiguous areas.}
#'
#'   \item{[add_connectivity_penalties()]}{Add penalties to a
#'     conservation problem to favor solutions that select
#'     planning units with high connectivity between them.}
#'
#'   \item{[add_linear_penalties()]}{Add penalties to a
#'     conservation problem to favor solutions that avoid selecting
#'     planning units based on a certain variable
#'     (e.g., anthropogenic pressure).}
