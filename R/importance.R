#' Evaluate solution importance
#'
#' Importance scores (also known as irreplaceability scores) can be used to
#' assess the relative importance of planning units selected in a solution to a
#' conservation planning problem.
#'
#' @details
#' The following methods are available for calculating importance scores
#' for a solution to a conservation planning [problem()]:
#'
#' \describe{
#'
#' \item{[eval_replacement_importance()]}{
#'   Calculate importance scores using replacement costs (based
#'   on Cabeza and Moilanen 2006).
#'   These scores quantify the change in the objective
#'   function (e.g., additional costs required to meet feature targets) of the
#'   optimal solution if a given planning unit in a solution cannot be acquired.
#'   They can (i) account for the cost of different planning units, (ii) account
#'   for multiple management zones, (iii) apply to any objective function, and
#'   (iv) identify truly irreplaceable planning units (denoted with infinite
#'   values).}
#'
#' \item{[eval_ferrier_importance()]}{
#'  Calculate importance scores following Ferrier *et al.* (2000).
#'  These scores measure importance based on how critical
#'  planning units are for meeting targets. They can only be applied to
#'  conservation problems that use targets and a single zone
#'  (e.g., the classic *Marxan*-type problem). Furthermore -- unlike the
#'  replacement cost scores -- these scores provide a
#'  score for each feature within each planning unit, providing insight into
#'  why certain planning units are more important than other planning units.}
#'
#' \item{[eval_rare_richness_importance()]}{
#'  Calculate importance scores using the rarity weighted richness metric
#' (based on Williams *et al.* 1996).
#' These score are simply a measure of biodiversity.
#' They do not account for planning costs, multiple management zones, objective
#' functions, or feature targets (or weightings).
#' They merely describe the spatial patterns of
#' biodiversity, and do not account for many of the factors needed to quantify
#' the importance of a planning unit for achieving conservation goals.}
#'
#' }
#'
#' Broadly speaking, we recommend using replacement cost scores where
#' possible. This is because they can be applied to any type of conservation
#' planning problem -- regardless of the objective function or number of
#' zones considered in the problem -- and measure planning unit importance based
#' on degradation of the prioritization.
#' Although the replacement cost scores can be calculated for small and
#' moderate sized problems (e.g., less than 30,000 planning units), they may not
#' be feasible for particularly large problems (e.g., more than 100,000 planning
#' units). In such cases, we recommend calculating importance scores using the
#' Ferrier method. This is because the Ferrier method can be
#' calculated relatively quickly for large-sized problems and it
#' explicitly accounts for representation targets.
#' We only recommend using the rarity weighted richness metric
#' when neither of the other two methods can be used.
