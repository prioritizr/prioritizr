#' Presolve check
#'
#' Check a conservation planning problem for potential issues
#' before trying to solve it. Specifically, problems are checked for (i) values
#' that are likely to result in "strange" solutions and (ii) values that are
#' likely to cause numerical instability issues and lead to unreasonably long
#' run times when solving it. Although these checks are provided to help
#' diagnose potential issues, please be aware that some detected issues may be
#' false positives. Please note that these checks will not be able to
#' verify if a problem has a feasible solution or not.
#'
#' @param x [problem()] or [optimization_problem()] object.
#'
#' @param warn `logical` should a warning be thrown if the presolve checks fail?
#'  Defaults to `TRUE`.
#'
#' @details This function checks for issues that are likely to result in
#'   "strange" solutions. Specifically, it checks if (i) all planning units are
#'   locked in, (ii) all planning units are locked out, and (iii) all
#'   planning units have negative cost values (after applying penalties if any
#'   were specified). Although such conservation planning problems
#'   are mathematically valid, they are generally the result of a coding mistake
#'   when building the problem (e.g., using an absurdly high
#'   penalty value or using the wrong dataset to lock in planning units).
#'   Thus such issues, if they are indeed issues and not false positives, can
#'   be fixed by carefully checking the code, data, and parameters used to build
#'   the conservation planning problem.
#'
#'   This function then checks for values that may lead to numerical instability
#'   issues when solving the problem. Specifically, it checks if the range of
#'   values in certain components of the optimization problem are over a
#'   certain threshold (i.e., \eqn{1 \times 10 ^9}{1e+9}) or if the values
#'   themselves exceed a certain threshold
#'   (i.e., \eqn{1 \times 10^{10}}{1e+10}).
#'   In most cases, such issues will simply cause an exact
#'   algorithm solver to take a very long time to generate a solution. In rare
#'   cases, such issues can cause incorrect calculations which can lead
#'   to exact algorithm solvers returning infeasible solutions
#'   (e.g., a solution to the minimum set problem where not all targets are met)
#'   or solutions that exceed the specified optimality gap (e.g., a suboptimal
#'   solution when a zero optimality gap is specified).
#'
#'   What can you do if a conservation planning problem fails to pass these
#'   checks? Well, this function will have thrown some warning messages
#'   describing the source of these issues, so read them carefully. For
#'   instance, a common issue is when a relatively large penalty value is
#'   specified for boundary ([add_boundary_penalties()]) or
#'   connectivity penalties ([add_connectivity_penalties()]). This
#'   can be fixed by trying a smaller penalty value. In such cases, the
#'   original penalty value supplied was so high that the optimal solution
#'   would just have selected every single planning unit in the solution---and
#'   this may not be especially helpful anyway (see below for example). Another
#'   common issue is that the
#'   planning unit cost values are too large. For example, if you express the
#'   costs of the planning units in terms of USD then you might have
#'   some planning units that cost over one billion dollars in large-scale
#'   planning exercises. This can be fixed by rescaling the values so that they
#'   are smaller (e.g., multiplying the values by a number smaller than one, or
#'   expressing them as a fraction of the maximum cost). Let's consider another
#'   common issue, let's pretend that you used habitat suitability models to
#'   predict the amount of suitable habitat
#'   in each planning unit for each feature. If you calculated the amount of
#'   suitable habitat in each planning unit in square meters then this
#'   could lead to very large numbers. You could fix this by converting
#'   the units from square meters to square kilometers or thousands of square
#'   kilometers. Alternatively, you could calculate the percentage of each
#'   planning unit that is occupied by suitable habitat, which will yield
#'   values between zero and one hundred.
#'
#'   But what can you do if you can't fix these issues by simply changing
#'   the penalty values or rescaling data? You will need to apply some creative
#'   thinking. Let's run through a couple of scenarios.
#'   Let's pretend that you have a few planning units that
#'   cost a billion times more than any other planning
#'   unit so you can't fix this by rescaling the cost values. In this case, it's
#'   extremely unlikely that these planning units will
#'   be selected in the optimal solution so just set the costs to zero and lock
#'   them out. If this procedure yields a problem with no feasible solution,
#'   because one (or several) of the planning units that you manually locked out
#'   contains critical habitat for a feature, then find out which planning
#'   unit(s) is causing this infeasibility and set its cost to zero. After
#'   solving the problem, you will need to manually recalculate the cost
#'   of the solutions but at least now you can be confident that you have the
#'   optimal solution. Now let's pretend that you are using the maximum features
#'   objective (i.e., [add_max_features_objective()]) and assigned some
#'   really high weights to the targets for some features to ensure that their
#'   targets were met in the optimal solution. If you set the weights for
#'   these features to one billion then you will probably run into numerical
#'   instability issues. Instead, you can calculate minimum weight needed to
#'   guarantee that these features will be represented in the optimal solution
#'   and use this value instead of one billion. This minimum weight value
#'   can be calculated as the sum of the weight values for the other features
#'   and adding a small number to it (e.g., 1). Finally, if you're running out
#'   of ideas for addressing numerical stability issues you have one remaining
#'   option: you can use the `numeric_focus` argument in the
#'   [add_gurobi_solver()] function to tell the solver to pay extra
#'   attention to numerical instability issues. This is not a free lunch,
#'   however, because telling the solver to pay extra attention to numerical
#'   issues can substantially increase run time. So, if you have problems that
#'   are already taking an unreasonable time to solve, then this will not help
#'   at all.
