#' Problem solvers
#'
#' Specify the software and configuration used to solve a conservation planning
#' [problem()]. By default, the best available
#' software currently installed on the system will be used.
#' For information on the performance of different solvers,
#' please see Schuster _et al._ (2020) for benchmarks comparing the
#' run time and solution quality of some of these solvers when applied to
#' different sized datasets.
#'
#' @details The following solvers can be used to find solutions for a
#'   conservation planning [problem()]:
#'
#'   \describe{
#'
#'   \item{[add_default_solver()]}{This solver uses the best software
#'     currently installed on the system.}
#'
#'   \item{[add_gurobi_solver()]}{[*Gurobi*](https://www.gurobi.com/)
#'     is a state-of-the-art commercial optimization software with an R package
#'     interface. We recommend using this solver if at all possible.
#'     It is by far the fastest of the solvers available for
#'     generating prioritizations, however, it is not freely available. That
#'     said, licenses are available to academics at no cost. The
#'     \pkg{gurobi} package is distributed with the *Gurobi* software
#'     suite. This solver uses the \pkg{gurobi} package to solve problems.}
#'
#'   \item{[add_cplex_solver()]}{[*IBM CPLEX*](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer)
#'     is a commercial optimization software. It is faster than the open
#'     source solvers available for generating prioritizations, however, it
#'     is not freely available.
#'     Similar to the [*Gurobi*](https://www.gurobi.com/)
#'     software, licenses are available to academics at no cost.
#'     This solver uses the \pkg{cplexAPI} package to solve problems using
#'     *IBM CPLEX*.}
#'
#'  \item{[add_cbc_solver()]}{[*CBC*](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) is an
#'    open-source mixed integer programming solver that is part of the
#'     Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR) project.
#'     Preliminary benchmarks indicate that it is the fastest open source
#'     solver currently supported.
#'     We recommend using this solver if both *Gurobi* and *IBM CPLEX* are
#'     unavailable.
#'     It requires the \pkg{rcbc} package, which is currently only available on
#'     [GitHub](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/rcbc).
#'  }
#'
#'   \item{[add_lpsymphony_solver()]}{
#'     [*SYMPHONY*](https://projects.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY) is an
#'     open-source mixed integer programming solver that is also part of the
#'     COIN-OR project. Although both *SYMPHONY* and *CBC* are part of
#'     the COIN-OR project, they are different software.
#'     The \pkg{lpsymphony} package provides an interface to the *SYMPHONY*
#'     software, and is distributed through
#'     [Bioconductor](https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.lpsymphony).
#'     We recommend using this solver if the CBC solver cannot be installed.
#'     This solver can use parallel processing to solve problems, so it is
#'     faster than \pkg{Rsymphony} package interface (see below).
#'  }
#'
#'   \item{[add_rsymphony_solver()]}{
#'     This solver provides an alternative interface to the
#'     [*SYMPHONY*](https://projects.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY) solver using
#'     the \pkg{Rsymphony} package.
#'     Unlike other solvers, the \pkg{Rsymphony} package can be installed
#'     directly from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
#'     It is also the slowest of the available solvers.}
